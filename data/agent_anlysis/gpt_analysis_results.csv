  -
NSF sponsored Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) may submit proposals provided that they do not include costs for which federal funds have already been awarded or are expected to be awarded.


*Who May Serve as PI:

The PI and any Co-PIs must hold an appointment at an organization that is eligible to submit as described under ""Who May Submit Proposals."" At least one PI or Co-PI from a Phase-1 award must be included as a PI or Co-PI on the Phase-2 proposal that is based on that Phase-1 award. The same individual who served as PI for the Phase-1 award does not have to be PI for the Phase-2 proposal, however any change of PI and Co-PI should be fully explained in the Phase-2 proposal. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The Regional Resilience Innovation Incubators (R2I2) is a cross-directorate NSF solicitation led by the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) and the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP). R2I2 will support community- engaged team science to co-design high-impact solutions to climate-related societal challenges that leverage recent advances in fundamental climate change and Earth system science research. Each R2I2 project will address specific regional climate challenges and will develop and demonstrate solutions to those challenges that can be effectively applied in real- world settings. Investment in R2I2 will leverage past federal investments in addressing climate change and will provide a bridge connecting advancements in basic science with local knowledge, informed decision making, and technological innovations for societal applications.


R2I2 will be implemented in two phases, concept creation and implementation. This solicitation, focused on Phase-1, will fund a series of pilot projects focusing on project concept creation and refinement for solutions specific to a U.S. climate region.


Targeted areas for establishing R2I2 incubators will be based on ten climate regions defined by the Fifth National Climate Assessment (Table 1.1): Northeast, Southeast, U.S. Caribbean, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, Northwest, Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaii & U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands. Although geographic diversity will be a factor considered when determining the portfolio of awards, the review process may result in funding multiple projects in one climate region and none in others. Individual R2I2 projects may propose solutions that apply to more than one climate region defined above. This solicitation will also fund an award for the creation of a R2I2 National Office (RNO) to support the collective and coordinated implementation of R2I2 award activities. NSF envisions the release of a separate solicitation for Phase-2 implementation projects in fiscal year 2026, subject to the availability of funds. Only Phase-1 award recipients will be eligible to submit Phase-2 proposals. Phase-2 awards will be selected based on a merit review of Phase-2 proposals and performance during Phase-1.

NSF EPSCoR facilitates the establishment of partnerships among academic institutions, government, industry, and non-profit sectors that are designed to promote sustainable improvements in the research infrastructure, Research and Development (R&D) capacity, and R&D competitiveness of EPSCoR-eligible jurisdictions (i.e., states, territories, and commonwealths).


The E-RISE RII program supports the incubation of research teams and products in a scientific topical area that links to research priorities identified in the submitting jurisdiction’s approved Science and Technology (S&T) Plan. E-RISE RII invites innovative proposals that will lead to development and implementation of sustainable broad networks of individuals, institutions, and organizations that will transform the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) research capacity and competitiveness in a jurisdiction within the chosen field of research. E-RISE RII projects must be designed to incubate (i) areas of research capacity building within a chosen research topic; (ii) development of a skilled workforce that is relevant to the project and its outcomes; (iii) promotion of diversity, equity, access, and a culture of inclusion of different types of academic institutions (see below) and non-academic sectors (e.g., industry and government); (iv) integration of the research with societal impacts in a timebound manner; and (v) sustainability of a clear pathway towards preserving the resulting research incubator's team and products beyond E-RISE RII funding.

This NOFO supports small business concerns (SBCs) in employing and developing researchers as entrepreneurial Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs). In addition to augmenting scientific research staff and supporting research and development efforts at SBCs, a major component of this NOFO is entrepreneurial training, mentoring, and career development of the PD/PI.
