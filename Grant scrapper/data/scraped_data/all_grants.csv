R2I2 will support community- engaged team science to co-design high-impact solutions to climate-related societal challenges that leverage recent advances in fundamental climate change and Earth system science research. Each R2I2 project will address specific regional climate challenges and will develop and demonstrate solutions to those challenges that can be effectively applied in real- world settings. Investment in R2I2 will leverage past federal investments in addressing climate change and will provide a bridge connecting advancements in basic science with local knowledge, informed decision making, and technological innovations for societal applications. R2I2 will be implemented in two phases, concept creation and implementation. This solicitation, focused on Phase-1, will fund a series of pilot projects focusing on project concept creation and refinement for solutions specific to a U.S. climate region. Targeted areas for establishing R2I2 incubators will be based on ten climate regions defined by the Fifth National Climate Assessment (Table 1.1): Northeast, Southeast, U.S. Caribbean, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, Northwest, Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaii & U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands. Although geographic diversity will be a factor considered when determining the portfolio of awards, the review process may result in funding multiple projects in one climate region and none in others. Individual R2I2 projects may propose solutions that apply to more than one climate region defined above. This solicitation will also fund an award for the creation of a R2I2 National Office (RNO) to support the collective and coordinated implementation of R2I2 award activities.\nNSF envisions the release of a separate solicitation for Phase-2 implementation projects in fiscal year 2026, subject to the availability of funds. Only Phase-1 award recipients will be eligible to submit Phase-2 proposals. Phase-2 awards will be selected based on a merit review of Phase-2 proposals and performance during Phase-1.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 24-595', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

All proposed programs must include an American element, either through a connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institutions/s, usage of American educational/informational resources, or any other activities that promote or contribute to increased mutual understanding between the people of the United States and people of Tajikistan. Competitive proposals will promote continued and sustainable cooperation between the people of the United States and Tajikistan even after the project concludes.  \nCompetitive proposals will include partnership with Tajik governmental bodies, and to organizations that have a demonstrated track record of implementing such programs. \nExamples of programs could include, but are not limited to:\n·        Academic or professional exchanges, lectures, seminars, trainings, speaker programs, or workshops; and\n·        Artistic, cultural, or sports workshops, masterclasses, joint performances, and/or exhibitions.\n  PDS welcomes proposals that support one of the following priority program areas:\n   TOPIC 1: Counter Gender-based Violence (GBV) \n  Domestic violence (DV) and gender-based violence (GBV) remains a serious issue in Tajikistan—and much of the world. In a USAID-funded survey in Tajikistan, 97% of men and 60% of women believed spousal abuse was justified. Cases of GBV and DV are underreported because victims wish to avoid humiliation, reprisal, or social stigmatization, or believe it may have been warranted. Further, authorities wishing to promote traditional gender roles frequently dismiss domestic violence as a “family matter” or only gave a warning or fine. Government resources for survivors are also limited.\n  Project Audience(s) may include: \n·        Religiously or socially conservative communities, especially Tajik men (18-50 years old)\n·        High school students (14-18 years old.)\n·        Youth and emerging leaders (18-35 years old.)\n·        University teachers and students.\n·        Labor migrants and spouses of labor migrants.\n·        Tajik advocacy groups.\n·        Government bodies.\n·        Independent media including bloggers and vloggers\n  Countering Gender-Based Violence Project Goal:\n  Empower civil society and communities in Tajikistan to prevent and prosecute cases of Domestic Violence (DV) or Gender-Based Violence (GBV) through community-led initiatives.\n  Project Objectives (may address one or more of the following):\n  ·        Messaging campaigns or awareness raising activities, such as sports diplomacy, should engage and target both men and women. Having men as the face of campaigns, or having men speak to men standing against GBV, demonstrates solidarity and emphasizes that eradicating gender-based violence is the collective responsibility of everyone, regardless of gender.\n·        Improve collaboration between civil society, independent media, and the government to identify and address gaps in existing laws and policies that criminalize GBV/DV, provide protections for victims, and establish legal frameworks for persecution. \n·         Raise awareness among vulnerable populations about laws, rights, and support services concerning early marriage, domestic abuse, harassment, divorce, alimony, and other civil rights.\n  TOPIC 2: Promoting Women’s Economic Empowerment and Entrepreneurship\nDue to the high rate of male labor migration and unemployment, more Tajik women are exploring ways to financially support their households and communities. However, women entrepreneurs' activities are highly dependent on the effectiveness of the business environment in the country. Moreover, the mountainous regions throughout the country challenge the development of entrepreneurship, as does lack of information, limited access to financing for starting a business, and other socio-economic conditions. Nevertheless, successful small business development creates new employment opportunities in Tajikistan and helps women support themselves and their families. Small businesses are fast becoming the main source of income for women in Tajikistan.\n  Proposed projects should enhance women’s participation, promotion, and longevity in the Tajik economy and ability to assume leadership positions. Projects should clearly support the protection of economic rights for women and increase respect for women’s rights in society to improve their independence and proactive role in Tajik society.\n  Project Audience(s) may include: \n·        Women from rural areas (including the spouses of labor migrants) and women entrepreneurs.\n·        Small businesses in rural areas.\n·        Business associations.\n·        Financial and government institutions.\n·        Tourism agencies (including guesthouse and small hotels).\n·        Community leaders and youth demonstrating leadership potential in these areas.\n  Women’s Economic Empowerment Project Goal:  Increase the capacity of women from underserved, rural communities, including the spouses of labor migrants, to participate or increase their participation in the Tajik economy. Improve women's economic opportunities in Tajikistan by increasing the capacity of women to start, establish, or expand their own companies.\n  Project Objectives (may address one or more of the following):\n  ·        Develop the business and technical skills of women in rural communities to increase employability, launch and/or improve their own businesses.\n·        Establish and conduct activities with a professional network for women from under-represented communities, including the spouses of labor migrants, to support mentorship relationships and collaborative initiatives among network members that go beyond the conclusion of project activities.\no  Projects could connect women’s entrepreneurship in the development of tourism around newly recognized UNESCO heritage sites.\no  Increase awareness of tourism initiatives and employment opportunities centered around newly designated UNESCO heritage sites.\no  Projects could seek to increase participation of women from underserved and target communities in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).\n·        Increase women’s knowledge and understanding about their legal rights in society and how to advocate for the respect of those rights. \no  Increase women’s knowledge and understanding about their legal rights in the workplace, including rights related to employment, equal pay, job security, and access to economic opportunities.\no  Equip Tajik women with the ability to advocate for the recognition and enforcement of these rights.\n·        Promote women’s economic empowerment and entrepreneurship through support from start-up hubs, corporate social responsibility, and/or access to finance. Emphasis should be placed on strengthening chambers of commerce, entrepreneurs, and core private sector industries through interactions or linkages with U.S. counterparts.\no  Facilitate access to funding resources and financing opportunities for women entrepreneurs to launch and grow their businesses.\no  Strengthen organizational capacities of chambers of commerce to support business development of aspiring female entrepreneurs.\no  Facilitate interactions and linkages between women entrepreneurs, chambers of commerce, startup hubs, and private sector industries in Tajikistan and their U.S. counterparts.\n  TOPIC 3: Sharing America with Tajikistan\n  The United States values innovation, creativity, critical thinking, freedom of expression, democratic principles, economic growth, and security. The United States supports a sovereign and independent Tajikistan, which includes support for a well-informed, discerning public who can inoculate itself against disinformation. Both the United States and Tajikistan have rich cultural traditions as shown in literature and storytelling, theater and performing arts, film, music, dance, sport, and education. Educational, cultural, and other exchange activities are a great way to engage the public, especially at-risk youth and those with neutral views or misconceptions about the United States, in order to bridge our cultures, deepen understanding, and discuss topics of mutual importance. Proposed projects should strengthen understanding between the United States and Tajikistan and advance areas of mutual interest by leveraging the experiences and lessons learned from the United States, while respecting cultural differences.\n  Project Audience(s) may include:\n·        Tajik audiences who have not had exposure to the United States before.\n·        Youth 16-35.\n·        Academia, professors, and teachers.\n·        Civil society, non-government organizations, and associations/organizations promoting shared values or areas of mutual interest.\n·        Information professionals (media outlets, managers, editors, journalists, influencers).\n·        Religious and community leaders.\n·        Entrepreneurs and business community advocacy organizations.\n·        National and subnational government officials.\n  Project Goal: To share American values, such as freedom of expression, respect for human rights, and celebrate/promote respect for diversity and social inclusion, while also improving access to objective information and increase media literacy and critical thinking skills to analyze mis and disinformation aimed at the United States. \n  Project Objectives (may address one or more of the following):\n·        Raise awareness about shared U.S.-Tajik values and partnerships through trainings, workshops, masterclasses, joint performances, or other projects by U.S. and/or Tajik experts.\n·        Increase access to American content by Tajik audiences (such as book translations) that promote U.S. democratic and rights-based values.\n·        Increase collaboration between local, state, and civil society actors/stakeholders on well-defined social issues affecting both the United States and Tajikistan by sharing U.S. models of government-community engagement, or by working with U.S. experts/peers. \n·        Increase the effectiveness of individuals, organizations, and coalitions working to advance and/or advocate for respect and the promotion of human rights.\n·        Strengthen the ability of Tajik media professionals to develop accurate and fact-based informational media campaigns through digital skills building and training initiatives based on U.S.-best practices.\n·        Increase production and publication of objective, fact-based and editorially diverse media content by Tajik media professionals.\n·        Increase critical thinking skills, especially for youth and publics with a neutral or view or misconceptions about the United States, to identify and critically analyze sources of misinformation and disinformation.\n  In addition to the specific requirements listed above by program area, all proposals must:\n1.     Clearly indicate the primary activity area to which it is being submitted for consideration.\n2.     Focus on the key public diplomacy audiences and activities specified in the areas, provide programs for underserved geographic regions of Tajikistan, as well as non-elite schools (if applicable);\n3.     Clearly delineate how elements of their program will have a multiplier effect and be sustainable beyond the life of the grant;\n4.     Provide a traditional and/or social media plan for marketing program activities and outcome, if applicable\n5.     Identify the cities/districts in which activities will take place.\n6.     Identify specific outcomes to be achieved by the end of the grant period.\n7.     Identify any tools (surveys, beneficiary interviews, focus groups, etc.) that will be developed for Monitoring and Evaluation purposes.\nApplicants must also demonstrate competency to manage all financial aspects of the project, including participant costs and transparent arrangements of sub-grant relationships with partner organizations, if applicable."", 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nSitora Kasimova\nGrantor\nPhone 992985808031\n\nGrantProposalsDushanbe@state.gov'}"

The mission of the LQC can be captured in three broad goals: 1) pursue disruptive fundamental research and enabling technologies with a focus on qubit development for quantum computing and other applications (such as sensing); 2) grow deep, collaborative partnerships to tackle the most difficult and relevant long-term problems in quantum information science and technology; and 3) build a quantum workforce of tomorrow through research experiences in government at LPS and at LQC partners. The LQC will offer a mechanism for collaborative research between LPS and academia, industry, FFRDCs, and Government Laboratories to advance foundational and transformative research on challenging problems that have hindered progress in quantum information processing and associated technologies.\n\nThe goal of this BAA is to seek proposals that bring together expertise from the public and private sectors and their respective research infrastructures to advance solutions that may be best approached as a collaborative team. A Collaboratory is “a center without walls, in which the nation’s researchers can perform their research without regard to physical location, interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, [and] accessing information in digital libraries. This BAA introduces LQC Research Thrusts (A.1.1) which are the technical areas of interest—which will be updated periodically—where partners of the LQC will pursue joint research with LPS through Incubator (A.1.2) and Collaboration (A.1.3) collaborative agreements. The LQC BAA also fulfills the Government’s overarching interest--through the proposed research and on-site research experiences--in creating and training a workforce in quantum science and technology, generating pathways of solutions that feed technology development, establishing partnerships, and creating transition opportunities. In further support of training through research, Section A.1.4 calls for Quantum Computing Research (QuaCR) Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships for US citizens working in areas of interest.\n\nSubstantial progress on solving the most difficult and long-term Quantum Information Science & Technology (QIST) research problems that unleash further rapid progress in the field will constitute LQC success. Examples of such research problems include (but are not limited to): limits of performance due to device design, material selection, and/or control, the exploration of alternative qubit physics (e.g., different approaches to qubit encoding or types of gates) and lowering of barriers to such approaches, advances in materials that improve qubit gate fidelity, reducing the overhead of classical components in quantum information technology and optimizing classical performance, and the exploration of applications of quantum technologies to new domains.\n\nThree categories of proposals are sought for this BAA:\n1.Incubator opportunities seek partnership proposals from single investigators and small research groups, including teaching colleges, who may have unique skillsets to contribute toward the pursuit of the research thrusts presented in A.1.1. Incubator proposals may also be the development of concepts into a detailed technical research approach to advance solution of problems of high interest to quantum information science research. Incubator proposals would avail themselves of the collaboration opportunities with LPS research staff and infrastructure made available at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) to lay the groundwork for concepts that may be suitable for a Collaboratory proposal or responses to other DoD quantum information science research opportunities.\n2.Collaboratory proposals seek research proposals that bring together a strong significant collaboration--researchers from academia, industry, FFRDCs, and/or Government Laboratories--to pursue long-term projects focused on fundamental problems of interest to qubit development and/or associated science and technology. These collaborative groups will propose to work together in a focused manner for a period of time expected to be one to three years in order to demonstrate a proof-of-concept experiment and/or theory exploration to determine the feasibility of their creative idea.\n3.QuaCR Research Fellowship proposals seek to support talented U.S. citizen graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the field of quantum information processing (primary interest) and quantum sensing (secondary interest). Applicants with a background from either within or outside QIS are encouraged. The proposed research areas are described in this BAA and must enhance active Quantum Information Science research efforts being supported by the Army Research Office and/or LPS. Research fellows are encouraged to complete an LPS Internship during their graduate career or visit during their postdoctoral fellowship', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'ARO & ARL BAA SITE', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nTechnical Program Point of Contact (ARO):\nDr. T.R.

Troops assemble in a base camp to receive new clothing, hot food, support services, and a relative degree of safety before returning to combat action. A DOL VETS-funded Stand Down event serves a similar purpose; however, it is intended for veterans experiencing or at-risk of homelessness. The critical services provided at these events are often the catalyst that enables those individuals to reenter the workforce.\n VETS awards these noncompetitive grants on a first-come, first-served basis to support one-day or multi-day events at up to $7,000 or $10,000, respectively. They are collaborative events coordinated between VA, DOL, other federal, state, and local government agencies and community-based organizations providing services and supplies to veterans experiencing and at risk of homelessness. In the event of a federal disaster declaration, VETS will accept applications up to $50,000 to conduct Stand Down events in the impacted areas.\n State, Territory, and Possession, county, city, local, special district, and Native American tribal governments and agencies, non-profit and for-profit entities, state and local workforce boards, institutions of higher education, public and tribal housing authorities and faith-based organizations are eligible to apply.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'DVET State Contact Information', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nQuestions regarding a SD grant application should be sent to the DVET in the state in which the event will take place.\n\nContact information for the DVET is available at: https://www.dol.gov/vets/aboutvets/regionaloffices/map.htm.\n\nN/A'}"

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): “(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that— (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.” ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. § 16538. The FOA and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.” Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”) should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). SBIR/STTR Program Overview: The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are Government-wide programs authorized under Section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. § 638). The objectives of the SBIR program are to (1) stimulate technological innovation in the private sector, (2) strengthen the role of Small Business Concerns in meeting Federal R&D needs, (3) increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R&D activities, (4) foster and encourage participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned Small Business Concerns, and (5) improve the return on investment from Federally funded research and economic benefits to the Nation. The objective of the STTR program is to stimulate cooperative partnerships of ideas and technologies between Small Business Concerns and partnering Research Institutions through Federally funded R&D activities. ARPA-E administers a joint SBIR/STTR program in accordance with the Small Business Act and the SBIR and STTR Policy Directive issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). ARPA-E provides SBIR/STTR funding in three phases (Phase I, Phase II, and Phase IIS). Program Overview: The Technologies to Emend and Obviate SYnthetic Nitrogen’s Toll on Emissions (TEOSYNTE) program aims to lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the cultivation of corn and sorghum used for United States ethanol production by 50%. The program will emphasize plant and microbial bio-design strategies that lower the application of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer on corn and sorghum fields while maintaining crop yields and reducing 50% of N2O emissions. Lowering the requirements of synthetic N fertilizer will also lower costs to farmers, as the cost of fertilizer is a significant portion of the operating expenses of a farm. This program will enable technologies to reduce N fertilizer consumption and N2O emissions. These technologies will transform agriculture and lower the N2O contribution to the carbon intensity (CI) of ethanol produced today for light duty vehicles and in the future for sustainable aviation fuel. Technologies developed under the TEOSYNTE program must achieve specific targets as outlined in Section I.E. in order to meet the program’s objectives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and N fertilizer usage over multiple seasons while maintaining crop yields.

Although the scientific literature or preliminary data may provide the rationale for conducting a clinical trial, investigators often lack critical information about the study population, accrual challenges, intervention, outcome/ endpoints, data/statistical challenges or operational risks necessary to finalize the trial protocol completely. These information gaps can result in multiple protocol changes before and after trial start-up, leading to the need for additional time and expenses that may prevent study completion. Further, the suitability and feasibility of new trial designs, which minimize infrastructure and reduce costs may need to be tested in the context of a particular intervention, at-risk group, symptom or venue. Preparatory studies may fill information gaps and address unknowns, improving trial design and knowledge of trial feasibility and thus saving NCI time and money.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-173.html', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNIH OER Webmaster\nOERWebmaster03@od.nih.gov\n\nSee Section VII.

This means that the value of the proposed research can be justified within an anthropological context. The program sets no priorities by either geographic region or time period. It also has no priorities in regard to theoretical orientation or question and it is the responsibility of the investigator to explain convincingly why the focus of their research is significant and has the potential to contribute to anthropological knowledge. While the program, in order to encourage innovative research, neither limits nor defines specific categories of research, most applications either request funds for field research or the analysis of archaeological material through multiple approaches.

Contemporary cultural anthropology is an arena in which diverse research traditions and methodologies are valid in investigations of human cultural variation. Recognizing the breadth of the field's contributions to science, the Cultural Anthropology Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, fieldwork/lab-based theoretically engaged and methodologically sophisticated research in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology. Because the National Science Foundation's mission is to support basic research, the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice, humanistic understanding or applied policy. A proposal that applies anthropological methods to a social problem but does not propose how that problem provides an opportunity to make a theory-testing and/or theory-expanding contribution to anthropology will be returned without review. Program research priorities include, but are not limited to, research that increases our understanding of:\nSociocultural drivers of critical anthropogenic processes such as deforestation, desertification, land cover change, urbanization and poverty.\nResilience and robustness of sociocultural systems.\nScientific principles underlying conflict, cooperation and altruism, as well as explanations of variation in culture, norms, behaviors and institutions.\nEconomy, culture, migration and globalization.\nVariability and change in kinship and family norms and practices.\nGeneral cultural and social principles underlining the drivers of health outcomes and disease transmission.\nBiocultural work that considers the nexus of human culture and its relationship with human biology.\nSocial regulation, governmentality and violence.\nOrigins of complexity in sociocultural systems.\nLanguage and culture: orality and literacy, sociolinguistics and cognition.\nTheoretically-informed approaches to co-production in relation to scientific understandings of human variability and environmental stewardship.\nMathematical and computational models of sociocultural systems such as social network analysis, agent-based models, multi-level models, and modes that integrate agent-based simulations and geographic information systems (GIS).\nSocio-cultural drivers of technology and technological systems such as AI, machine learning, augmented data, and platforms.\nAs part of its effort to encourage and support projects that explicitly integrate education and basic research, CA provides support to enhance and improve the conduct of doctoral dissertation projects designed and carried out by doctoral students enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education who are conducting scientific research that enhances basic scientific knowledge."", 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 24-605', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

R2I2 will support community- engaged team science to co-design high-impact solutions to climate-related societal challenges that leverage recent advances in fundamental climate change and Earth system science research. Each R2I2 project will address specific regional climate challenges and will develop and demonstrate solutions to those challenges that can be effectively applied in real- world settings. Investment in R2I2 will leverage past federal investments in addressing climate change and will provide a bridge connecting advancements in basic science with local knowledge, informed decision making, and technological innovations for societal applications. R2I2 will be implemented in two phases, concept creation and implementation. This solicitation, focused on Phase-1, will fund a series of pilot projects focusing on project concept creation and refinement for solutions specific to a U.S. climate region. Targeted areas for establishing R2I2 incubators will be based on ten climate regions defined by the Fifth National Climate Assessment (Table 1.1): Northeast, Southeast, U.S. Caribbean, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, Northwest, Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaii & U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands. Although geographic diversity will be a factor considered when determining the portfolio of awards, the review process may result in funding multiple projects in one climate region and none in others. Individual R2I2 projects may propose solutions that apply to more than one climate region defined above.

All proposed programs must include an American element, either through a connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institutions/s, usage of American educational/informational resources, or any other activities that promote or contribute to increased mutual understanding between the people of the United States and people of Tajikistan. Competitive proposals will promote continued and sustainable cooperation between the people of the United States and Tajikistan even after the project concludes.  \nCompetitive proposals will include partnership with Tajik governmental bodies, and to organizations that have a demonstrated track record of implementing such programs. \nExamples of programs could include, but are not limited to:\n·        Academic or professional exchanges, lectures, seminars, trainings, speaker programs, or workshops; and\n·        Artistic, cultural, or sports workshops, masterclasses, joint performances, and/or exhibitions.\n  PDS welcomes proposals that support one of the following priority program areas:\n   TOPIC 1: Counter Gender-based Violence (GBV) \n  Domestic violence (DV) and gender-based violence (GBV) remains a serious issue in Tajikistan—and much of the world. In a USAID-funded survey in Tajikistan, 97% of men and 60% of women believed spousal abuse was justified. Cases of GBV and DV are underreported because victims wish to avoid humiliation, reprisal, or social stigmatization, or believe it may have been warranted. Further, authorities wishing to promote traditional gender roles frequently dismiss domestic violence as a “family matter” or only gave a warning or fine. Government resources for survivors are also limited.\n  Project Audience(s) may include: \n·        Religiously or socially conservative communities, especially Tajik men (18-50 years old)\n·        High school students (14-18 years old.)\n·        Youth and emerging leaders (18-35 years old.)\n·        University teachers and students.\n·        Labor migrants and spouses of labor migrants.\n·        Tajik advocacy groups.\n·        Government bodies.\n·        Independent media including bloggers and vloggers\n  Countering Gender-Based Violence Project Goal:\n  Empower civil society and communities in Tajikistan to prevent and prosecute cases of Domestic Violence (DV) or Gender-Based Violence (GBV) through community-led initiatives.\n  Project Objectives (may address one or more of the following):\n  ·        Messaging campaigns or awareness raising activities, such as sports diplomacy, should engage and target both men and women. Having men as the face of campaigns, or having men speak to men standing against GBV, demonstrates solidarity and emphasizes that eradicating gender-based violence is the collective responsibility of everyone, regardless of gender.\n·        Improve collaboration between civil society, independent media, and the government to identify and address gaps in existing laws and policies that criminalize GBV/DV, provide protections for victims, and establish legal frameworks for persecution. \n·         Raise awareness among vulnerable populations about laws, rights, and support services concerning early marriage, domestic abuse, harassment, divorce, alimony, and other civil rights.\n  TOPIC 2: Promoting Women’s Economic Empowerment and Entrepreneurship\nDue to the high rate of male labor migration and unemployment, more Tajik women are exploring ways to financially support their households and communities. However, women entrepreneurs' activities are highly dependent on the effectiveness of the business environment in the country. Moreover, the mountainous regions throughout the country challenge the development of entrepreneurship, as does lack of information, limited access to financing for starting a business, and other socio-economic conditions. Nevertheless, successful small business development creates new employment opportunities in Tajikistan and helps women support themselves and their families. Small businesses are fast becoming the main source of income for women in Tajikistan.\n  Proposed projects should enhance women’s participation, promotion, and longevity in the Tajik economy and ability to assume leadership positions. Projects should clearly support the protection of economic rights for women and increase respect for women’s rights in society to improve their independence and proactive role in Tajik society.\n  Project Audience(s) may include: \n·        Women from rural areas (including the spouses of labor migrants) and women entrepreneurs.\n·        Small businesses in rural areas.\n·        Business associations.\n·        Financial and government institutions.\n·        Tourism agencies (including guesthouse and small hotels).\n·        Community leaders and youth demonstrating leadership potential in these areas.\n  Women’s Economic Empowerment Project Goal:  Increase the capacity of women from underserved, rural communities, including the spouses of labor migrants, to participate or increase their participation in the Tajik economy. Improve women's economic opportunities in Tajikistan by increasing the capacity of women to start, establish, or expand their own companies.\n  Project Objectives (may address one or more of the following):\n  ·        Develop the business and technical skills of women in rural communities to increase employability, launch and/or improve their own businesses.\n·        Establish and conduct activities with a professional network for women from under-represented communities, including the spouses of labor migrants, to support mentorship relationships and collaborative initiatives among network members that go beyond the conclusion of project activities.\no  Projects could connect women’s entrepreneurship in the development of tourism around newly recognized UNESCO heritage sites.\no  Increase awareness of tourism initiatives and employment opportunities centered around newly designated UNESCO heritage sites.\no  Projects could seek to increase participation of women from underserved and target communities in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).\n·        Increase women’s knowledge and understanding about their legal rights in society and how to advocate for the respect of those rights. \no  Increase women’s knowledge and understanding about their legal rights in the workplace, including rights related to employment, equal pay, job security, and access to economic opportunities.\no  Equip Tajik women with the ability to advocate for the recognition and enforcement of these rights.\n·        Promote women’s economic empowerment and entrepreneurship through support from start-up hubs, corporate social responsibility, and/or access to finance.

Each R2I2 project will address specific regional climate challenges and will develop and demonstrate solutions to those challenges that can be effectively applied in real- world settings. Investment in R2I2 will leverage past federal investments in addressing climate change and will provide a bridge connecting advancements in basic science with local knowledge, informed decision making, and technological innovations for societal applications. R2I2 will be implemented in two phases, concept creation and implementation. This solicitation, focused on Phase-1, will fund a series of pilot projects focusing on project concept creation and refinement for solutions specific to a U.S. climate region. Targeted areas for establishing R2I2 incubators will be based on ten climate regions defined by the Fifth National Climate Assessment (Table 1.1): Northeast, Southeast, U.S. Caribbean, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, Northwest, Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaii & U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands. Although geographic diversity will be a factor considered when determining the portfolio of awards, the review process may result in funding multiple projects in one climate region and none in others. Individual R2I2 projects may propose solutions that apply to more than one climate region defined above. This solicitation will also fund an award for the creation of a R2I2 National Office (RNO) to support the collective and coordinated implementation of R2I2 award activities.\nNSF envisions the release of a separate solicitation for Phase-2 implementation projects in fiscal year 2026, subject to the availability of funds.

Each R2I2 project will address specific regional climate challenges and will develop and demonstrate solutions to those challenges that can be effectively applied in real- world settings. Investment in R2I2 will leverage past federal investments in addressing climate change and will provide a bridge connecting advancements in basic science with local knowledge, informed decision making, and technological innovations for societal applications. R2I2 will be implemented in two phases, concept creation and implementation. This solicitation, focused on Phase-1, will fund a series of pilot projects focusing on project concept creation and refinement for solutions specific to a U.S. climate region. Targeted areas for establishing R2I2 incubators will be based on ten climate regions defined by the Fifth National Climate Assessment (Table 1.1): Northeast, Southeast, U.S. Caribbean, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, Northwest, Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaii & U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands. Although geographic diversity will be a factor considered when determining the portfolio of awards, the review process may result in funding multiple projects in one climate region and none in others. Individual R2I2 projects may propose solutions that apply to more than one climate region defined above. This solicitation will also fund an award for the creation of a R2I2 National Office (RNO) to support the collective and coordinated implementation of R2I2 award activities.\nNSF envisions the release of a separate solicitation for Phase-2 implementation projects in fiscal year 2026, subject to the availability of funds. Only Phase-1 award recipients will be eligible to submit Phase-2 proposals. Phase-2 awards will be selected based on a merit review of Phase-2 proposals and performance during Phase-1.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 24-595', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

By funding startups and small businesses, NSF helps build a strong national economy and stimulates the creation of novel products, services, and solutions in private, public, or government sectors with potential for broad impact; strengthens the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increases the commercial application of federally supported research results; and develops and increases the US workforce, especially by fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses. These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs provide fixed amount cooperative agreements for thedevelopment of a broad range of technologiesbased on discoveries in science and engineeringwith potential for societal and economic impacts. Unlike fundamental or basic research activities that focus on scientific and engineering discovery itself, the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support the creation of opportunities to move use-inspired and translational discoveries out of the lab and into the market or other use at scale, through startups and small businesses.The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs do not solicit specific technologies or procure goods and services from startups and small businesses.Any invention conceivedorreduced to practice with the assistance ofSBIR/STTR fundingis subject to the Bayh-Dole Act. For more information refer toSBIR/STTR Frequently Asked Questions #75. NSF promotes inclusion by encouraging proposals from diverse populations and geographic locations. The traditional NSF SBIR/STTR programs include two funding Phases – Phase I and Phase II. All proposers to the programs must first apply for Phase I funding – there is no direct-to-Phase II option. Under a traditional NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I award, a small business can receive non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&D) to demonstrate technical feasibility over 6 to 12 months and then, after completion of a Phase I project, companies may apply for Phase II funding to further develop the proposed technology. There aresignificantbenefits for SBIR/STTRFast-Track recipients:the submission of only oneproposalfor Phase I and Phase IIand a faster transition from Phase I to Phase II.While startups and small businesses face many challenges, NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track funding is intended to specifically focus on challenges associated with technological innovation; that is, on the creation of new products, services, and other scalable solutions based on fundamental science or engineering. A successful Fast-Track proposal must demonstrate how NSF funding will help the small business create a proof-of-concept or prototype by retiring technical risk. NSF seeks unproven, leading-edge, technology innovations that demonstrate the following characteristics:\nThe innovations are underpinned and enabled by a new scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation.\nThe innovations still require intensive technical research and development to be fully embedded in a reliable product or service.\nThe innovations have not yet been reduced to practice by anyone and it is not guaranteed, at present, that doing so is technically possible.\nThe innovations provide a strong competitive advantage that are not easily replicable by competitors (even technically proficient ones).\nOnce reduced to practice, the innovations are expected to result in a product or service that would either be disruptive to existing markets or create new markets/new market segments.\nThe NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and start-ups by translating new scientific and engineering concepts into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. The programs provide non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&D) of use-inspired scientific and engineering activities at the earliest stages of the company and technology development. During the course of the award, the emphasis is expected to shift from de-risking those aspects preventing the innovation from reaching technical feasibility and driving the intended impact to a greater focus on commercially relevant development activities that will allow the company to differentiate itself and drive new value propositions to the market and society. NSF encourages input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities. These NSF programs are governed by15 USC 638and the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC §1861, et seq.). Introduction to the Program The NSF SBIR/STTR programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and startups by translating new scientific and engineering discoveries emerging from the private sector, federal labs, and academia into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs enable companies based on previous NSF awards (NSF award lineage) to submita single proposalthat, if awarded, can provide a faster pathway from Phase I to Phase II funding.Receipt of full funding under the Fast-Track pilot programs is contingent on the results of a company’s Phase II transition review. The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs are part of theDirectorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), which was recently launched to accelerate innovation and enhance economic competitiveness by catalyzing partnerships and investments that strengthen the links between fundamental research and technology development, deployment, and use.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 24-582', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

R2I2 will support community- engaged team science to co-design high-impact solutions to climate-related societal challenges that leverage recent advances in fundamental climate change and Earth system science research. Each R2I2 project will address specific regional climate challenges and will develop and demonstrate solutions to those challenges that can be effectively applied in real- world settings. Investment in R2I2 will leverage past federal investments in addressing climate change and will provide a bridge connecting advancements in basic science with local knowledge, informed decision making, and technological innovations for societal applications. R2I2 will be implemented in two phases, concept creation and implementation. This solicitation, focused on Phase-1, will fund a series of pilot projects focusing on project concept creation and refinement for solutions specific to a U.S. climate region. Targeted areas for establishing R2I2 incubators will be based on ten climate regions defined by the Fifth National Climate Assessment (Table 1.1): Northeast, Southeast, U.S. Caribbean, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, Northwest, Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaii & U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands. Although geographic diversity will be a factor considered when determining the portfolio of awards, the review process may result in funding multiple projects in one climate region and none in others. Individual R2I2 projects may propose solutions that apply to more than one climate region defined above. This solicitation will also fund an award for the creation of a R2I2 National Office (RNO) to support the collective and coordinated implementation of R2I2 award activities.\nNSF envisions the release of a separate solicitation for Phase-2 implementation projects in fiscal year 2026, subject to the availability of funds. Only Phase-1 award recipients will be eligible to submit Phase-2 proposals. Phase-2 awards will be selected based on a merit review of Phase-2 proposals and performance during Phase-1.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 24-595', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

By funding startups and small businesses, NSF helps build a strong national economy and stimulates the creation of novel products, services, and solutions in private, public, or government sectors with potential for broad impact; strengthens the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increases the commercial application of federally supported research results; and develops and increases the US workforce, especially by fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses. These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs provide fixed amount cooperative agreements for thedevelopment of a broad range of technologiesbased on discoveries in science and engineeringwith potential for societal and economic impacts. Unlike fundamental or basic research activities that focus on scientific and engineering discovery itself, the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support the creation of opportunities to move use-inspired and translational discoveries out of the lab and into the market or other use at scale, through startups and small businesses.The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs do not solicit specific technologies or procure goods and services from startups and small businesses.Any invention conceivedorreduced to practice with the assistance ofSBIR/STTR fundingis subject to the Bayh-Dole Act. For more information refer toSBIR/STTR Frequently Asked Questions #75. NSF promotes inclusion by encouraging proposals from diverse populations and geographic locations. The traditional NSF SBIR/STTR programs include two funding Phases – Phase I and Phase II. All proposers to the programs must first apply for Phase I funding – there is no direct-to-Phase II option. Under a traditional NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I award, a small business can receive non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&D) to demonstrate technical feasibility over 6 to 12 months and then, after completion of a Phase I project, companies may apply for Phase II funding to further develop the proposed technology. There aresignificantbenefits for SBIR/STTRFast-Track recipients:the submission of only oneproposalfor Phase I and Phase IIand a faster transition from Phase I to Phase II.While startups and small businesses face many challenges, NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track funding is intended to specifically focus on challenges associated with technological innovation; that is, on the creation of new products, services, and other scalable solutions based on fundamental science or engineering. A successful Fast-Track proposal must demonstrate how NSF funding will help the small business create a proof-of-concept or prototype by retiring technical risk. NSF seeks unproven, leading-edge, technology innovations that demonstrate the following characteristics:\nThe innovations are underpinned and enabled by a new scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation.\nThe innovations still require intensive technical research and development to be fully embedded in a reliable product or service.\nThe innovations have not yet been reduced to practice by anyone and it is not guaranteed, at present, that doing so is technically possible.\nThe innovations provide a strong competitive advantage that are not easily replicable by competitors (even technically proficient ones).\nOnce reduced to practice, the innovations are expected to result in a product or service that would either be disruptive to existing markets or create new markets/new market segments.\nThe NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and start-ups by translating new scientific and engineering concepts into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. The programs provide non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&D) of use-inspired scientific and engineering activities at the earliest stages of the company and technology development. During the course of the award, the emphasis is expected to shift from de-risking those aspects preventing the innovation from reaching technical feasibility and driving the intended impact to a greater focus on commercially relevant development activities that will allow the company to differentiate itself and drive new value propositions to the market and society. NSF encourages input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities. These NSF programs are governed by15 USC 638and the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC §1861, et seq.). Introduction to the Program The NSF SBIR/STTR programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and startups by translating new scientific and engineering discoveries emerging from the private sector, federal labs, and academia into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs enable companies based on previous NSF awards (NSF award lineage) to submita single proposalthat, if awarded, can provide a faster pathway from Phase I to Phase II funding.Receipt of full funding under the Fast-Track pilot programs is contingent on the results of a company’s Phase II transition review. The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs are part of theDirectorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), which was recently launched to accelerate innovation and enhance economic competitiveness by catalyzing partnerships and investments that strengthen the links between fundamental research and technology development, deployment, and use.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 24-582', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

All proposed programs must include an American element, either through a connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institutions/s, usage of American educational/informational resources, or any other activities that promote or contribute to increased mutual understanding between the people of the United States and people of Tajikistan. Competitive proposals will promote continued and sustainable cooperation between the people of the United States and Tajikistan even after the project concludes.  \nCompetitive proposals will include partnership with Tajik governmental bodies, and to organizations that have a demonstrated track record of implementing such programs. \nExamples of programs could include, but are not limited to:\n·        Academic or professional exchanges, lectures, seminars, trainings, speaker programs, or workshops; and\n·        Artistic, cultural, or sports workshops, masterclasses, joint performances, and/or exhibitions.\n  PDS welcomes proposals that support one of the following priority program areas:\n   TOPIC 1: Counter Gender-based Violence (GBV) \n  Domestic violence (DV) and gender-based violence (GBV) remains a serious issue in Tajikistan—and much of the world. In a USAID-funded survey in Tajikistan, 97% of men and 60% of women believed spousal abuse was justified. Cases of GBV and DV are underreported because victims wish to avoid humiliation, reprisal, or social stigmatization, or believe it may have been warranted. Further, authorities wishing to promote traditional gender roles frequently dismiss domestic violence as a “family matter” or only gave a warning or fine. Government resources for survivors are also limited.\n  Project Audience(s) may include: \n·        Religiously or socially conservative communities, especially Tajik men (18-50 years old)\n·        High school students (14-18 years old.)\n·        Youth and emerging leaders (18-35 years old.)\n·        University teachers and students.\n·        Labor migrants and spouses of labor migrants.\n·        Tajik advocacy groups.\n·        Government bodies.\n·        Independent media including bloggers and vloggers\n  Countering Gender-Based Violence Project Goal:\n  Empower civil society and communities in Tajikistan to prevent and prosecute cases of Domestic Violence (DV) or Gender-Based Violence (GBV) through community-led initiatives.\n  Project Objectives (may address one or more of the following):\n  ·        Messaging campaigns or awareness raising activities, such as sports diplomacy, should engage and target both men and women. Having men as the face of campaigns, or having men speak to men standing against GBV, demonstrates solidarity and emphasizes that eradicating gender-based violence is the collective responsibility of everyone, regardless of gender.\n·        Improve collaboration between civil society, independent media, and the government to identify and address gaps in existing laws and policies that criminalize GBV/DV, provide protections for victims, and establish legal frameworks for persecution. \n·         Raise awareness among vulnerable populations about laws, rights, and support services concerning early marriage, domestic abuse, harassment, divorce, alimony, and other civil rights.\n  TOPIC 2: Promoting Women’s Economic Empowerment and Entrepreneurship\nDue to the high rate of male labor migration and unemployment, more Tajik women are exploring ways to financially support their households and communities. However, women entrepreneurs' activities are highly dependent on the effectiveness of the business environment in the country. Moreover, the mountainous regions throughout the country challenge the development of entrepreneurship, as does lack of information, limited access to financing for starting a business, and other socio-economic conditions. Nevertheless, successful small business development creates new employment opportunities in Tajikistan and helps women support themselves and their families. Small businesses are fast becoming the main source of income for women in Tajikistan.\n  Proposed projects should enhance women’s participation, promotion, and longevity in the Tajik economy and ability to assume leadership positions. Projects should clearly support the protection of economic rights for women and increase respect for women’s rights in society to improve their independence and proactive role in Tajik society.\n  Project Audience(s) may include: \n·        Women from rural areas (including the spouses of labor migrants) and women entrepreneurs.\n·        Small businesses in rural areas.\n·        Business associations.\n·        Financial and government institutions.\n·        Tourism agencies (including guesthouse and small hotels).\n·        Community leaders and youth demonstrating leadership potential in these areas.\n  Women’s Economic Empowerment Project Goal:  Increase the capacity of women from underserved, rural communities, including the spouses of labor migrants, to participate or increase their participation in the Tajik economy. Improve women's economic opportunities in Tajikistan by increasing the capacity of women to start, establish, or expand their own companies.\n  Project Objectives (may address one or more of the following):\n  ·        Develop the business and technical skills of women in rural communities to increase employability, launch and/or improve their own businesses.\n·        Establish and conduct activities with a professional network for women from under-represented communities, including the spouses of labor migrants, to support mentorship relationships and collaborative initiatives among network members that go beyond the conclusion of project activities.\no  Projects could connect women’s entrepreneurship in the development of tourism around newly recognized UNESCO heritage sites.\no  Increase awareness of tourism initiatives and employment opportunities centered around newly designated UNESCO heritage sites.\no  Projects could seek to increase participation of women from underserved and target communities in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).\n·        Increase women’s knowledge and understanding about their legal rights in society and how to advocate for the respect of those rights. \no  Increase women’s knowledge and understanding about their legal rights in the workplace, including rights related to employment, equal pay, job security, and access to economic opportunities.\no  Equip Tajik women with the ability to advocate for the recognition and enforcement of these rights.\n·        Promote women’s economic empowerment and entrepreneurship through support from start-up hubs, corporate social responsibility, and/or access to finance. Emphasis should be placed on strengthening chambers of commerce, entrepreneurs, and core private sector industries through interactions or linkages with U.S. counterparts.\no  Facilitate access to funding resources and financing opportunities for women entrepreneurs to launch and grow their businesses.\no  Strengthen organizational capacities of chambers of commerce to support business development of aspiring female entrepreneurs.\no  Facilitate interactions and linkages between women entrepreneurs, chambers of commerce, startup hubs, and private sector industries in Tajikistan and their U.S. counterparts.\n  TOPIC 3: Sharing America with Tajikistan\n  The United States values innovation, creativity, critical thinking, freedom of expression, democratic principles, economic growth, and security. The United States supports a sovereign and independent Tajikistan, which includes support for a well-informed, discerning public who can inoculate itself against disinformation. Both the United States and Tajikistan have rich cultural traditions as shown in literature and storytelling, theater and performing arts, film, music, dance, sport, and education. Educational, cultural, and other exchange activities are a great way to engage the public, especially at-risk youth and those with neutral views or misconceptions about the United States, in order to bridge our cultures, deepen understanding, and discuss topics of mutual importance. Proposed projects should strengthen understanding between the United States and Tajikistan and advance areas of mutual interest by leveraging the experiences and lessons learned from the United States, while respecting cultural differences.\n  Project Audience(s) may include:\n·        Tajik audiences who have not had exposure to the United States before.\n·        Youth 16-35.\n·        Academia, professors, and teachers.\n·        Civil society, non-government organizations, and associations/organizations promoting shared values or areas of mutual interest.\n·        Information professionals (media outlets, managers, editors, journalists, influencers).\n·        Religious and community leaders.\n·        Entrepreneurs and business community advocacy organizations.\n·        National and subnational government officials.\n  Project Goal: To share American values, such as freedom of expression, respect for human rights, and celebrate/promote respect for diversity and social inclusion, while also improving access to objective information and increase media literacy and critical thinking skills to analyze mis and disinformation aimed at the United States. \n  Project Objectives (may address one or more of the following):\n·        Raise awareness about shared U.S.-Tajik values and partnerships through trainings, workshops, masterclasses, joint performances, or other projects by U.S. and/or Tajik experts.\n·        Increase access to American content by Tajik audiences (such as book translations) that promote U.S. democratic and rights-based values.\n·        Increase collaboration between local, state, and civil society actors/stakeholders on well-defined social issues affecting both the United States and Tajikistan by sharing U.S. models of government-community engagement, or by working with U.S. experts/peers. \n·        Increase the effectiveness of individuals, organizations, and coalitions working to advance and/or advocate for respect and the promotion of human rights.\n·        Strengthen the ability of Tajik media professionals to develop accurate and fact-based informational media campaigns through digital skills building and training initiatives based on U.S.-best practices.\n·        Increase production and publication of objective, fact-based and editorially diverse media content by Tajik media professionals.\n·        Increase critical thinking skills, especially for youth and publics with a neutral or view or misconceptions about the United States, to identify and critically analyze sources of misinformation and disinformation.\n  In addition to the specific requirements listed above by program area, all proposals must:\n1.     Clearly indicate the primary activity area to which it is being submitted for consideration.\n2.     Focus on the key public diplomacy audiences and activities specified in the areas, provide programs for underserved geographic regions of Tajikistan, as well as non-elite schools (if applicable);\n3.     Clearly delineate how elements of their program will have a multiplier effect and be sustainable beyond the life of the grant;\n4.     Provide a traditional and/or social media plan for marketing program activities and outcome, if applicable\n5.     Identify the cities/districts in which activities will take place.\n6.     Identify specific outcomes to be achieved by the end of the grant period.\n7.     Identify any tools (surveys, beneficiary interviews, focus groups, etc.) that will be developed for Monitoring and Evaluation purposes.\nApplicants must also demonstrate competency to manage all financial aspects of the project, including participant costs and transparent arrangements of sub-grant relationships with partner organizations, if applicable."", 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nSitora Kasimova\nGrantor\nPhone 992985808031\n\nGrantProposalsDushanbe@state.gov'}"

The mission of the LQC can be captured in three broad goals: 1) pursue disruptive fundamental research and enabling technologies with a focus on qubit development for quantum computing and other applications (such as sensing); 2) grow deep, collaborative partnerships to tackle the most difficult and relevant long-term problems in quantum information science and technology; and 3) build a quantum workforce of tomorrow through research experiences in government at LPS and at LQC partners. The LQC will offer a mechanism for collaborative research between LPS and academia, industry, FFRDCs, and Government Laboratories to advance foundational and transformative research on challenging problems that have hindered progress in quantum information processing and associated technologies.\n\nThe goal of this BAA is to seek proposals that bring together expertise from the public and private sectors and their respective research infrastructures to advance solutions that may be best approached as a collaborative team. A Collaboratory is “a center without walls, in which the nation’s researchers can perform their research without regard to physical location, interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, [and] accessing information in digital libraries. This BAA introduces LQC Research Thrusts (A.1.1) which are the technical areas of interest—which will be updated periodically—where partners of the LQC will pursue joint research with LPS through Incubator (A.1.2) and Collaboration (A.1.3) collaborative agreements. The LQC BAA also fulfills the Government’s overarching interest--through the proposed research and on-site research experiences--in creating and training a workforce in quantum science and technology, generating pathways of solutions that feed technology development, establishing partnerships, and creating transition opportunities. In further support of training through research, Section A.1.4 calls for Quantum Computing Research (QuaCR) Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships for US citizens working in areas of interest.\n\nSubstantial progress on solving the most difficult and long-term Quantum Information Science & Technology (QIST) research problems that unleash further rapid progress in the field will constitute LQC success. Examples of such research problems include (but are not limited to): limits of performance due to device design, material selection, and/or control, the exploration of alternative qubit physics (e.g., different approaches to qubit encoding or types of gates) and lowering of barriers to such approaches, advances in materials that improve qubit gate fidelity, reducing the overhead of classical components in quantum information technology and optimizing classical performance, and the exploration of applications of quantum technologies to new domains.\n\nThree categories of proposals are sought for this BAA:\n1.Incubator opportunities seek partnership proposals from single investigators and small research groups, including teaching colleges, who may have unique skillsets to contribute toward the pursuit of the research thrusts presented in A.1.1. Incubator proposals may also be the development of concepts into a detailed technical research approach to advance solution of problems of high interest to quantum information science research. Incubator proposals would avail themselves of the collaboration opportunities with LPS research staff and infrastructure made available at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) to lay the groundwork for concepts that may be suitable for a Collaboratory proposal or responses to other DoD quantum information science research opportunities.\n2.Collaboratory proposals seek research proposals that bring together a strong significant collaboration--researchers from academia, industry, FFRDCs, and/or Government Laboratories--to pursue long-term projects focused on fundamental problems of interest to qubit development and/or associated science and technology. These collaborative groups will propose to work together in a focused manner for a period of time expected to be one to three years in order to demonstrate a proof-of-concept experiment and/or theory exploration to determine the feasibility of their creative idea.\n3.QuaCR Research Fellowship proposals seek to support talented U.S. citizen graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the field of quantum information processing (primary interest) and quantum sensing (secondary interest). Applicants with a background from either within or outside QIS are encouraged. The proposed research areas are described in this BAA and must enhance active Quantum Information Science research efforts being supported by the Army Research Office and/or LPS.

Listed species under NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) jurisdiction may spend all or part of their life cycles in state waters, and success in conserving these species depends largely on working cooperatively with the States. NMFS is authorized to provide Federal assistance to eligible State agencies to support the development and implementation of conservation programs for listed marine and anadromous species that reside within that State. This assistance, provided in the form of grants or cooperative agreements through the Species Recovery Grants to States Program, can be used to support conservation activities for any endangered or threatened species, as well as monitoring of candidate species, recently delisted species, and species proposed for listing under the ESA. Proposals that address the recovery of the following endangered species are encouraged as part of the agency’s Species in the Spotlight initiative: Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) Gulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment (DPS), Cook Inlet DPS of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), Hawaiian monk seals (Neomonachus schauinslandi), North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), Pacific leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), Rice’s whale (Balaenoptera ricei), southern resident DPS of killer whales (Orcinus orca), and white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni). Funded activities may include development and implementation of management efforts, scientific research, and public education and outreach. Any State agency that has entered into an agreement with NMFS pursuant to section 6(c) of the ESA or enters into such an agreement within 30 days of the application deadline is eligible to apply under this solicitation. Proposals focusing on Pacific salmonids will not be considered for funding under this grant program; such projects may be considered through the NMFS Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. Additionally, proposals focusing on sea turtle stranding response and/or rehabilitation will not be considered for funding under this grant program; such projects may be considered and funded by NOAA through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Sea Turtles Program.

Troops assemble in a base camp to receive new clothing, hot food, support services, and a relative degree of safety before returning to combat action. A DOL VETS-funded Stand Down event serves a similar purpose; however, it is intended for veterans experiencing or at-risk of homelessness. The critical services provided at these events are often the catalyst that enables those individuals to reenter the workforce.\n VETS awards these noncompetitive grants on a first-come, first-served basis to support one-day or multi-day events at up to $7,000 or $10,000, respectively. They are collaborative events coordinated between VA, DOL, other federal, state, and local government agencies and community-based organizations providing services and supplies to veterans experiencing and at risk of homelessness. In the event of a federal disaster declaration, VETS will accept applications up to $50,000 to conduct Stand Down events in the impacted areas.\n State, Territory, and Possession, county, city, local, special district, and Native American tribal governments and agencies, non-profit and for-profit entities, state and local workforce boards, institutions of higher education, public and tribal housing authorities and faith-based organizations are eligible to apply.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'DVET State Contact Information', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nQuestions regarding a SD grant application should be sent to the DVET in the state in which the event will take place.\n\nContact information for the DVET is available at: https://www.dol.gov/vets/aboutvets/regionaloffices/map.htm.\n\nN/A'}"

If interested, please carefully review the instructions below.\n\nThe SSH is a grass-roots grant assistance program that allows U.S. Ambassadors to support local requests for small community-based development projects. The purpose of the Special Self-Help Program is to support communities through modest grants that will positively impact local communities. The SSH philosophy is to help communities help themselves. Projects submitted for SSH must align with one or more U.S. Embassy priorities: \nEconomic diversification, including small business creation and income generation \nProjects must aim to 1) generate sustainable income and employment opportunities in local communities, 2) advance economic diversification and encourage use of local natural resources or income generation, 3) promote a culture of entrepreneurship, and/or 4) improve economic or living conditions of a community.\nWomen start-ups and women entrepreneurs\nEligible projects assist women who are launching a business or who are overseeing the early stages of business development (between one to two years). Such projects must promote a culture of women-led entrepreneurship and innovation that can be replicated in the community. Projects must also promote profitable businesses that generate revenue and benefit the community.\nSocial and economic inclusion and creation of opportunities\nProjects in this category must assist youth, children, women (particularly female heads of household), and other vulnerable groups to gain access to basic services (for example water, sanitation, and primary/pre-K education). They can also assist the creation of opportunities for vulnerable groups, particularly employment for youth.\nEnvironmental protection, sustainability, resilience to environmental vulnerabilities, and adaptation to environmental change\nEligible projects will increase the capacity of communities to cope with vulnerability to drought and other environmental changes by building resilience, increasing capacity to adapt, and promoting income-generating activities. For example, projects may involve activities to improve water management, diversify agricultural practices, or provide benefits to the environment.\n\n Local Community Involvement: \n Local involvement of the organization or group must be at least 10% in cash or in kind of the total project costs. The community contribution of funding may be crucial to make a choice between two viable requestors. In-kind contributions could be: labor (wages of masons and workers), food, accommodation for qualified labor, carts of sand or gravel, bricks for construction, sand, fence, water supply, transportation costs, donations of materials etc.\nAdditionally, community leaders can sign a statement of interest. Community leaders include local municipal leaders, religious leaders, civil society leaders, or any governing body that has oversight over where the project will be implemented. One community leader can sign the statement of interest; however, multiple signatures are strongly encouraged. Community leaders may also submit letters of support for the project.\n\n Elements of a Successful Project\nThe project is initiated by the community.\nThe project plan contains pre-established long-term goals and a coherent plan to keep the project running in the future.\nA capable project manager who is a long-term resident in the community is responsible for the project.\nThere is strong coordination and communication among the grant recipient, local leaders, and local government representatives.\nThe project makes use of materials and supplies that can be maintained by the community, and the materials that will not harm the environment.\nThe project has a high beneficiary to budget ratio, benefiting a significant number of community members\nThe project budget is clear, complete, and well defined.\nThe project responds to a community need and is based on a well-developed proposal that is responsive to the priorities and criteria explained in this NOFO.\nProject activities and results show long-term sustainability.\nApplication Documents and Procedures\n1.

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): “(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that— (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.” ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. § 16538. The FOA and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.” Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”) should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). SBIR/STTR Program Overview: The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are Government-wide programs authorized under Section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. § 638). The objectives of the SBIR program are to (1) stimulate technological innovation in the private sector, (2) strengthen the role of Small Business Concerns in meeting Federal R&D needs, (3) increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R&D activities, (4) foster and encourage participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned Small Business Concerns, and (5) improve the return on investment from Federally funded research and economic benefits to the Nation. The objective of the STTR program is to stimulate cooperative partnerships of ideas and technologies between Small Business Concerns and partnering Research Institutions through Federally funded R&D activities. ARPA-E administers a joint SBIR/STTR program in accordance with the Small Business Act and the SBIR and STTR Policy Directive issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). ARPA-E provides SBIR/STTR funding in three phases (Phase I, Phase II, and Phase IIS). Program Overview: The Technologies to Emend and Obviate SYnthetic Nitrogen’s Toll on Emissions (TEOSYNTE) program aims to lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the cultivation of corn and sorghum used for United States ethanol production by 50%. The program will emphasize plant and microbial bio-design strategies that lower the application of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer on corn and sorghum fields while maintaining crop yields and reducing 50% of N2O emissions. Lowering the requirements of synthetic N fertilizer will also lower costs to farmers, as the cost of fertilizer is a significant portion of the operating expenses of a farm. This program will enable technologies to reduce N fertilizer consumption and N2O emissions. These technologies will transform agriculture and lower the N2O contribution to the carbon intensity (CI) of ethanol produced today for light duty vehicles and in the future for sustainable aviation fuel. Technologies developed under the TEOSYNTE program must achieve specific targets as outlined in Section I.E. in order to meet the program’s objectives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and N fertilizer usage over multiple seasons while maintaining crop yields.

Although the scientific literature or preliminary data may provide the rationale for conducting a clinical trial, investigators often lack critical information about the study population, accrual challenges, intervention, outcome/ endpoints, data/statistical challenges or operational risks necessary to finalize the trial protocol completely. These information gaps can result in multiple protocol changes before and after trial start-up, leading to the need for additional time and expenses that may prevent study completion. Further, the suitability and feasibility of new trial designs, which minimize infrastructure and reduce costs may need to be tested in the context of a particular intervention, at-risk group, symptom or venue. Preparatory studies may fill information gaps and address unknowns, improving trial design and knowledge of trial feasibility and thus saving NCI time and money.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-173.html', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNIH OER Webmaster\nOERWebmaster03@od.nih.gov\n\nSee Section VII.

Contemporary cultural anthropology is an arena in which diverse research traditions and methodologies are valid in investigations of human cultural variation. Recognizing the breadth of the field's contributions to science, the Cultural Anthropology Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, fieldwork/lab-based theoretically engaged and methodologically sophisticated research in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology. Because the National Science Foundation's mission is to support basic research, the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice, humanistic understanding or applied policy. A proposal that applies anthropological methods to a social problem but does not propose how that problem provides an opportunity to make a theory-testing and/or theory-expanding contribution to anthropology will be returned without review. Program research priorities include, but are not limited to, research that increases our understanding of:\nSociocultural drivers of critical anthropogenic processes such as deforestation, desertification, land cover change, urbanization and poverty.\nResilience and robustness of sociocultural systems.\nScientific principles underlying conflict, cooperation and altruism, as well as explanations of variation in culture, norms, behaviors and institutions.\nEconomy, culture, migration and globalization.\nVariability and change in kinship and family norms and practices.\nGeneral cultural and social principles underlining the drivers of health outcomes and disease transmission.\nBiocultural work that considers the nexus of human culture and its relationship with human biology.\nSocial regulation, governmentality and violence.\nOrigins of complexity in sociocultural systems.\nLanguage and culture: orality and literacy, sociolinguistics and cognition.\nTheoretically-informed approaches to co-production in relation to scientific understandings of human variability and environmental stewardship.\nMathematical and computational models of sociocultural systems such as social network analysis, agent-based models, multi-level models, and modes that integrate agent-based simulations and geographic information systems (GIS).\nSocio-cultural drivers of technology and technological systems such as AI, machine learning, augmented data, and platforms.\nAs part of its effort to encourage and support projects that explicitly integrate education and basic research, CA provides support to enhance and improve the conduct of doctoral dissertation projects designed and carried out by doctoral students enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education who are conducting scientific research that enhances basic scientific knowledge."", 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 24-605', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

Refer to the individual topic for its respective maximum award size (a proposal submitted that exceeds the maximum award size for the respective topic will be declined without review). The period of performance will depend on the scope of the effort but will not exceed 12 months. Please note that the Phase II grant application will be due approximately 9.5 months after the grant start date. This will be the only opportunity to submit a Phase II application for a Phase I award made under this FOA. Grantees that select a Phase I period of performance of 9 months or less will be able to complete their Phase I project prior to submission of their Phase II grant application. Grantees that select a Phase I longer than 9 months will be able to continue research and development (R&D) after their Phase II application is submitted but will not be able to utilize these results in the preparation of their Phase II application.\n\nPhase I is to evaluate, insofar as possible, the scientific or technical merit and feasibility of ideas that appear to have commercial potential and/or substantial application in support of DOE mission research. The grant application should concentrate on research that will contribute to proving scientific or technical feasibility of the approach or concept. Success in a DOE Phase I is a prerequisite to further DOE support in Phase II.\n\nOnly awardees issued Phase I grants under this FOA are eligible to submit a Phase II application under the corresponding FY 2026 Phase II FOA, i.e., FY 2026 Phase II Release 1.\n\nApproximately 40% of Phase I awardees submitting a Phase II application will receive a Phase II award. Instructions and eligibility requirements for submitting Phase II grant applications will be posted at a later date on the internet at https://www.grants.gov/. \n\nThe objectives of the SBIR/STTR programs include increasing private sector commercialization of technology developed through DOE-supported research and development (R&D), stimulating technological innovation in the private sector, encouraging participation by women-owned and minority-owned small businesses, and improving the return on investment from Federally funded research for economic and social benefits to the nation. DOE will support high-quality research or R&D on innovative concepts concerning important mission-related scientific or engineering problems and opportunities that have high potential for commercialization.

Research funded under this award mechanism will be hypothesis-driven, high-impact applied research that is relevant to Service Members, Veterans, their Families, and the American public.\nApplicants may leverage existing resources in translational research to address essential research ideas or unmet needs to enable the delivery of life-saving care to the Warfighter during prolonged and en route care in austere and combat environments. For this award mechanism, the definition of “leveraging” is as follows: an investigator basing a research project on existing resources in order to amplify potential gains in knowledge or accelerate technical maturity. Research of interest may include knowledge products, “knowledge resulting from research with the potential to improve individual or public health,”1 and solutions that can accelerate the introduction of military-relevant health products or technologies into clinical and/or operational use. Projects should take into consideration the varied expertise levels of targeted medical providers, available resources, and the possible diverse environmental conditions in combat situations. Proposal/application submissions are encouraged to include characteristics relevant to military use in the pre-hospital, combat operational setting. Submissions that propose solutions to advance civilian trauma care are not precluded, since civilian trauma and trauma care in the military are mutually influential and may be co-occurring in certain situations.\nImpact is a key component of this award mechanism. The potential impact of the research, both short term and long term, in addressing the FY24 CRRP Focus Area(s) should be clearly described. Successful high-impact research should lead to the accelerated translation of applicable advances for improving medical readiness, mitigating fatalities, optimally treating life-threatening injuries, and promoting positive long-term outcomes for military health and medicine, as well as the general public.\nKey aspects of the CRRP TRA Mechanism:\n•\nThis BAA may be used to support applied, preclinical, clinical research, and/or small-scale clinical trials (e.g., first in human, phase 1/1b).\n•\nPreliminary data are required: Inclusion of preliminary data relevant to the proposed study is required.\nApplications in response to this BAA may not be used to support fundamental basic research. For this BAA, basic research is defined as research directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications toward process or products in mind. Applied and preclinical research, including animal studies, that is already supported by substantial preliminary or published data, and is designed to validate clinical translation, is appropriate for this award mechanism.\nFunding from this BAA may not be used to support studies requiring an exception from informed consent (EFIC).\nFunding from this BAA may not be used to support larger or advanced clinical trials (e.g., phase 2/3, pivotal).\nA clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials.\nFor the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes:\n(1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies.\n(2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention.\n(3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial.\nExcluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. Rigor of Experimental Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis, et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies.\nWomen’s Health: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women's health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women’s health.\nRelevance to Military Health: Relevance to the health care needs the Warfighter ahead of deployment and in operational environments is a key feature of this award. Use of DOD or Department of VA Resources: Applications engaging investigators within the military Services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military Services, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and/or their Families. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research.\nInnovative research involving nuclear medicine and related techniques to support early diagnosis, more effective treatment, and improved health outcomes of active-duty Service Members and their Families is encouraged. Such research could improve diagnostic and targeted treatment capabilities through noninvasive techniques and may drive the development of precision imaging and advanced targeted therapies.\nThe CDMRP intends that information, data, and research resources generated under awards funded by this program announcement be made available to the research community (which includes both scientific and consumer advocacy communities) and to the public at large.\nThe funding instrument for awards made under this BAA will be assistance agreements, contracts, or Other Transactions. The type of instrument used to reflect the business relationship between the organization and the government is at the discretion of the government, in accordance with the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, as amended, 31 USC 6301-6308, which provides the legal criteria to select a procurement contract or an assistance agreement. The USAMRDC will also consider the use of Other Transactions (OTs) as a vehicle for award, in accordance with the conditions in 10 USC 4021 and 10 USC 4022.\nAn assistance agreement can take the form of a grant or cooperative agreement. The level of involvement on the part of the CDMRP during the project’s period of performance is the key factor in determining whether to award a grant or cooperative agreement. If “no substantial involvement” on the part of the CDMRP is anticipated, a grant will be made (31 USC 6304). Conversely, if “substantial involvement” on the part of the CDMRP is anticipated, a cooperative agreement will be made (31 USC 6305). Substantial involvement means that, after award, CDMRP staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities.\nA contract is required when the principal purpose of the instrument is to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the U.S. government (31 USC 6303).\nAn “Other Transaction” is appropriate to carry out certain prototypes, research, and production projects (10 USC 4021 and 10 USC 4022). Other Transaction authorities were created to provide the flexibility necessary to adopt and incorporate business practices that reflect commercial industry standards and best practices into its award instruments.\nThe award type, along with the start date, will be determined during the negotiation process.\nThe anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 CRRP TRA Award should not exceed $1.1M. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information.\nAwards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025.\nThe CDMRP expects to allot approximately $3.3M to fund approximately three CRRP TRA Awards. Funding of applications/proposals received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications/proposals received, the quality and merit of the applications/proposals as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030."", 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nCDMRP Help Desk\nPhone: 301-682-5507\nEmail: help@eBRAP.org\n\nCDMRP Help Desk'}"

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. Awards under this BAA are expected to take the form of Contracts, Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions may also be awarded if appropriate. NRL encourages Educational Institutions, Small Businesses (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (SDBs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) to submit proposals under this BAA.\n\nIn order to conserve valuable offeror and Government resources, prospective offerors shall first submit a White Paper (WP) to the email address identified in the individual Summary Topics contained in Appendix 1, to include a rough cost estimate. If there is interest in the proposed research the offeror will be invited to submit a Formal Proposal. The selection of proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA Summary Topic. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds.

They are of crucial importance for producing goods and services, creating value, providing jobs, and achieving social goals. The Science of Organizations (SoO) program funds basic research that yields a scientific evidence base for improving the design and emergence, development and deployment, and management and ultimate effectiveness of organizations of all kinds. SoO funds research that advances our fundamental understanding of how organizations develop, form and operate. Successful SoO research proposals use scientific methods to develop and refine theories, to empirically test theories and frameworks, and to develop new measures and methods. Funded research is aimed at yielding generalizable insights that are of value to the business practitioner, policy-maker and research communities. SoO welcomes any and all rigorous, scientific approaches that illuminate aspects of organizations as systems of coordination, management and governance. In considering whether a particular project might be a candidate for consideration by SoO, please note:\nIntellectual perspectives may involve (but are not limited to) organizational theory, behavior, sociology or economics, business policy and strategy, communication sciences, entrepreneurship, human resource management, information sciences, managerial and organizational cognition, operations management, public administration, social or industrial psychology, and technology and innovation management.\nPhenomena studied may include (but are not limited to) structures, routines, effectiveness, competitiveness, innovation, dynamics, change and evolution.\nLevels of analysis may include (but are not limited to) organizational, cross-organizational collaborations or relationships, and institutional and can address individuals, groups or teams.\nResearch methods may be qualitative and quantitative and may include (but are not limited to) archival analyses, surveys, simulation studies, experiments, comparative case studies, and network analyses.\nConsistent with NSF merit review criteria, each SoO proposal should discuss both the intellectual merit and the potential broader impacts of the proposed research. SoO values basic research that has the potential to provide broader societal benefits. However, the majority of space in any proposal will need to be dedicated to the explication of theory, methods, and specific contribution to the evidence base about organizational effectiveness. Projects that aim to implement and subsequently evaluate particular organizational training, effectiveness or change programs, rather than to advance fundamental, generalizable knowledge, are not appropriate for SoO. Researchers who seek to conduct SoO-appropriate research in an industrial site and/or via an industry-university collaboration are invited to also look at the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry (GOALI) program web site.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Program Desccription PD-11-8031', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

Initially, scholarships were only provided for students in mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Later legislation authorized NSF to expand the eligible disciplines at the discretion of the NSF director. Undergraduate and graduate degrees in most disciplinary fields in which NSF provides research funding (with some exclusions described elsewhere in this document) are eligible as long as there is a national or regional demand for professionals with those degrees to address the long-term workforce needs of the United States. The main goal of the S-STEM program is to enable low-income students with academic ability, talent or potential to pursue successful careers in promising STEM fields. Ultimately, the S-STEM program seeks to increase the number of academically promising low-income students who graduate with a S-STEM eligible degree and contribute to the American innovation economy with their STEM knowledge. Recognizing that financial aid alone cannot increase retention and graduation in STEM, the program provides awards to institutions of higher education (IHEs) not only to fund scholarships, but also to adapt, implement, and study evidence-based curricular and co-curricular [1] activities that have been shown to be effective supporting recruitment, retention, transfer (if appropriate), student success, academic/career pathways, and graduation in STEM. Social mobility for low-income students with academic potential is even more crucial than for students that enjoy other economic support structures. Hence, social mobility cannot be guaranteed unless the scholarship funds the pursuit of degrees in areas where rewarding jobs are available after graduation with an undergraduate or graduate degree. The S-STEM program encourages collaborations, including but not limited to partnerships among different types of institutions; collaborations of S-STEM eligible faculty, researchers, and academic administrators focused on investigating the factors that affect low-income student success (e.g., institutional, educational, behavioral and social science researchers); and partnerships among institutions of higher education and business, industry, local community organizations, national labs, or other federal or state government organizations, as appropriate. To be eligible, scholars must be domestic low-income students, with academic ability, talent or potential and with demonstrated unmet financial need who are enrolled in an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree program in an S-STEM eligible discipline. Proposers must provide an analysis that articulates the characteristics and academic needs of the population of students they are trying to serve. NSF is particularly interested in supporting the attainment of degrees in fields identified as critical needs for the Nation. Many of these fields have high demand for training professionals that can operate at the convergence of disciplines and include but are not limited to quantum computing and quantum science, robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, computer science and computer engineering, data science and computational science applied to other frontier STEM areas, and other STEM or technology fields in urgent need of domestic professionals. It is up to the proposer to make a compelling case that a field is a critical need field in the United States. S-STEM Eligible Degree Programs Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Engineering, and Associate of Applied Science Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Applied Science Master of Arts, Master of Science and Master of Engineering Doctoral (Ph.D. or other comparable doctoral degree) S-STEM Eligible Disciplines Disciplinary fields in which research is funded by NSF, including technology fields associated with the S-STEM-eligible disciplines (e.g., biotechnology, chemical technology, engineering technology, information technology, etc.). The following degrees and disciplines are excluded:\nClinical degree programs, including medical degrees, nursing, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, physical therapy, and others not funded by NSF, are ineligible degrees.\nBusiness school programs that lead to Bachelor of Arts or Science in Business Administration degrees (BABA/BSBA/BBA) are not eligible for S-STEM funding.\nMasters and Doctoral degrees in Business Administration are also excluded.\nProposers are strongly encouraged to contact Program Officers before submitting a proposal if they have questions concerning degree or disciplinary eligibility.

Future Manufacturing seeks inventive approaches to invigorate the manufacturing ecosystem and seed nascent future industries that can only be imagined today. Future Manufacturing supports research and education that will enhance U.S. leadership in manufacturing by providing new capabilities for companies and entrepreneurs, by improving our health, quality of life, and national security, by expanding job opportunities to a diverse STEM workforce, and by reducing adverse impacts of manufacturing on the environment. At the same time, Future Manufacturing enables new manufacturing that will address urgent social challenges arising from climate change, global pandemics and health disparities, social and economic divides, infrastructure deficits of marginalized populations and communities, and environmental sustainability. Future Manufacturing will complement existing efforts, supported by NSF and other federal agencies, in advanced manufacturing, but the focus of this program is to enable new, potentially transformative, manufacturing capabilities rather than to improve current manufacturing. Proposals that are incremental improvements over existing advanced manufacturing technologies will not be competitive. The 2022 National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing (NSAM) shows how advances in U.S. manufacturing enable the economy to continuously grow as new technologies and innovations increase productivity, enable next-generation products, support our capability to address the climate crisis, and create new, high-quality, and higher-paying jobs. It highlights the need to enhance environmental sustainability and address climate change through objectives that include decarbonization of processes and sustainable manufacturing and recycling. The CHIPS and Science Actsupports research and education in semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing and in other areas ranging from additive manufacturing to artificial intelligence. The recent Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy aims to expand domestic biomanufacturing capacity for products spanning the health, energy, agriculture, and industrial sectors. Manufacturing in the future will rely on computation to ensure the reliable translation of product designs to manufacturing plans; process controls to assure those plans produce products that meet specifications; new materials, chemicals, devices, processes, machines, and design and work methods; systems that encompass people, processes, equipment, materials, and information within a production environment; and new social structures and business practices. Fundamental research to overcome significant barriers will be required in quantum and semiconductor devices and integrated systems, robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, sustainable chemistry and production, materials science, education and public policy, and workforce development. Three thrust areas have been identified for support under this solicitation: Future Cyber Manufacturing Research, Future Eco Manufacturing Research, and Future Biomanufacturing Research. This solicitation seeks proposals to perform fundamental research to enable new manufacturing capabilities in one or more of these thrust areas. This solicitation will support the following two award tracks: Future Manufacturing Research Grants (FMRG) - up to $3,000,000 for up to four years; and Future Manufacturing Seed Grants (FMSG) - up to $500,000 for up to two years. Proposals should take a convergence approachthat involves cross-disciplinary partnerships among engineers, scientists, mathematicians, social and behavioral scientists, STEM education researchers, and experts in arts and humanities. Team sizes should be commensurate with the scope of the plans for science, technology, innovation, and education and workforce development. Proposals that include significant participation from minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, community colleges, institutions from EPSCoR states, and/or incorporate expertise in improving diversity and inclusion are especially encouraged. The goal of this solicitation is to enable new manufacturing that represents a significant change from current practice. Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include within the Project Description a section titled Enabling Future Manufacturing. Please see ""Proposal Preparation Instructions"" for additional details. Realization of the benefits of the fundamental research supported under this solicitation will require the simultaneous education of a skilled technical workforce that can transition new discoveries into U.S. manufacturing companies. The National Science Board emphasizes this perspective in its report, ""THE SKILLED TECHNICAL WORKFORCE: Crafting America\'s Science and Engineering Enterprise."" Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include a plan to equip students and upskill the workforce to enable Future Manufacturing. Please see ""Proposal Preparation Instructions"" for additional details. The results of Future Manufacturing could change how workers interact with technology. Investigators may choose to address challenges in this area by including an optional component of research which focuses on future workers and their interactions with the new technology. Please see ""Proposal Preparation Instructions"" for specifics. FURTHER INFORMATION: Informational webinars will be held on February 2, 2024 from 1:00-2:00 PM EST and November 15, 2024 from 1:00-2:00 PM to discuss the Future Manufacturing program and answer questions about this solicitation.

Many NSF-funded projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-source products, including software, hardware, models, specifications, programming languages, or data platforms that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and/or government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on anexisting open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE. POSE constitutes a new pathway to translate scientific innovations, akin to the Lab-to-Market Platform that NSF has pioneered over many decades. Whereas programs like theNSF Innovation Corps (NSF I-Corps™)andAmerica’s Seed Fund[Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)]represent an integrated set of programs to provide researchers with the capacity to transform their fundamental research into deep technology ventures, POSE is specifically focused on another translational pathway – supporting the transition from open-source research artifacts to OSEs. Importantly, the POSE program isnotintended to fund thedevelopmentof open-source products, including tools and artifacts. The POSE program is alsonotintended to fund existing well-resourced, open-source communities or ecosystems. Instead, the program aims to supportnewmanaging organizations to catalyze distributed, community-driven development and growth ofnewOSEs. The expected outcomes of the POSE program are to grow the community of researchers and innovators who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and to enable pathways for the safe and secure development of OSEs that have broad societal impacts. OSEs can emerge from any areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) research and development. This solicitation seeks two types of proposals, allowing teams to propose specific activities toscope and planthe establishment of an OSE (Phase I), and toestablisha sustainable OSE based on a robust open-source product that shows promise in the ability to both meet an emergent societal or national need and build a community to help develop it (Phase II). Phase I: OSE Scoping and Planning Proposals Phase I projects are for open-source research products with a small community of external users though the product may not necessarily have external content developers. The objectives of Phase I projects are to: (1) enable scoping activities that will inform the transition of promising research products that are already available in open-source formats into sustainable and robust OSEs that will have broad societal impacts, and (2) provide training to teams interested in building such an OSE. Phase I awardees are not obligated to submit Phase II proposals in the future. Phase II: Establishment and Expansion Proposals Phase II projects are for open-source research products with small, existing communities of external usersandexternal content developers. The objective of Phase II projects is to support the transition of a promising open-source product into a sustainable and robust OSE. Phase II proposal teams are expected to have already conducted the scoping activities needed to develop a detailed project plan to support the community-driven distributed development and deployment of successful open-source tools into operational environments (not necessarily via a Phase I award). An NSF POSE Phase I award is not required for the submission of a Phase II proposal.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 24-606', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

The goals of the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Program, created in 2011 by NSF,are tospur translation of fundamental research to the marketplace, to encourage collaboration between academia and industry, and to train NSF-funded faculty, students and other researchers in innovation and entrepreneurship skills. The I-Corps Program utilizes experiential learning of customer and industry discovery, coupled with first-hand investigation of industrial processes, to quickly assess the translational potential of inventions. The I-Corps Program is designed to support the commercialization of ""deep technologies,” those revolving around fundamental discoveries in science and engineering. The I-Corps Program addresses the skill and knowledge gaps associated with the transformation of basic research into deep technology ventures (DTVs). The purpose of the I-Corps Teams program is to identify NSF-funded researchers to receive additional support in the form of entrepreneurial education, mentoring, and funding to accelerate the translation of knowledge derived from fundamental research into emerging products and services that may attract subsequent third-party funding. The outcomes of I-Corps Teams\' projects are threefold: 1) a decision on a clear path forward based on an assessment of the business model, 2) substantial first-hand evidence for or against product-market fit, with the identification of customer segments and corresponding value propositions, and 3) a narrative of a technology demonstrationfor potential partners. WEBINAR: A webinar will be held monthly to answer questions about this program. Details will be posted on the I-Corps Teams website (seehttps://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/program.jsp) as they become available.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 21-552', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

Each NSF Engine represents a formal coalition of regional partners, led by a full-time Chief Executive Officer (CEO), tasked to carry out an integrated and comprehensive set of activities spanning use-inspired research, translation of innovation to practice, entrepreneurship, workforce development, community engagement, and ecosystem building, to nurture and accelerate the growth of regional innovation ecosystems grounded in technological innovation and regional, national, societal, and/or geostrategic challenges. The mission of an NSF Engine must be clearly rooted in regional interests and reflect the aspiration that a regional innovation ecosystem can help build strong communities where all residents can thrive. This includes the equitable development of regional talent, intentional community engagement, and attention to impacts on a region’s identities and cultures. The NSF Engines program is a placed-based innovation funding initiative, where the emphasis on “regions” expresses NSF’s aim to stimulate innovation-driven economic growth within a particular place or region of service. The emphasis of the NSF Engines program further includes creating new business and economic growth in sectors that are critical to American competitiveness and in those regions of America that have not fully participated in the technology boom of the past several decades.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 24-565', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing (PRO Housing) empowers communities that are actively taking steps to remove barriers to affordable housing and seeking to increase housing production and lower housing costs over the long term. Barriers to affordable housing may take the form of restrictive zoning designations, land use policies, or regulations; discretionary, costly or prolonged procedures; deteriorating or inadequate infrastructure; lack of neighborhood amenities; neighborhood opposition to new or affordable housing; or challenges to preserving existing housing stock such as increasing threats from natural hazards, redevelopment that reduces the number of affordable units, displacement pressures, or expiration of affordability requirements.Across the United States, regulatory and other barriers have made it difficult to produce, preserve, and access affordable housing. Constrained supply drives up housing costs and reduces affordability. According to American Community Survey estimates in 2021, 39.3 million households (20.9 million renters and 18.4 million homeowners) have been classified as “cost-burdened,” spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing. Cost burden is even greater for underserved populations. Black families face affordability challenges as homeowners and renters more than any other racial or ethnic group, spending between 30 to 50 percent of their income on housing. In Puerto Rico, cost-burdened households face severe affordability challenges, spending between 50 to 90 percent of their income on housing. Limited access to housing has long-term effects on access to opportunity and ability to build generational wealth, especially for underserved communities of color and low-income people. Affordability challenges and the lack of affordable housing supply further increase eviction pressures and likelihood of homelessness for low-income people.In 2024, HUD awarded the inaugural PRO Housing competitive grants to 21 winners to advance housing opportunities in communities across 19 states and the District of Columbia. The first-round competition was greatly oversubscribed. For every dollar made available for fiscal year 2023, thirteen dollars were requested. HUD received over 150 applications from nearly every state and territory. The considerable interest in this first-of-its-kind funding is an indication of the need for resources to address barriers to housing production and preservation across the county. The applicants and winners represent rural, suburban, and urban communities ranging from under 5,000 residents to millions. While communities have seen historic levels of federal investments in housing and infrastructure, there is still a need to address the barriers that inhibit or slow housing production. Barriers such as high cost of land, lack of available units, inadequate infrastructure, gaps in financing, restrictive zoning, risks of displacement, expiring affordability, and increased threats from extreme weather and an aging housing stock were common themes throughout the initial applications. PRO Housing funding enables awardees to address those barriers through planning, infrastructure, development, and preservation actions to further local housing goals.HUD is issuing this second PRO Housing NOFO under the authority of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118-42, approved March 9, 2024) (Appropriations Act), which appropriates $100 million for competitive grant funding for the identification and removal of barriers to affordable housing production and preservation. Congress has directed HUD to undertake a competition using the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) statutory and regulatory framework. Under this NOFO, HUD will provide PRO Housing grants to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation. Grantees may use awards to further develop, evaluate, and implement housing policy plans, improve housing strategies, and facilitate affordable housing production and preservation. Eligible applicants are State and local governments, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and multijurisdictional entities.HUD has six goals for this competition:Fairly and effectively award the PRO Housing grant funding;Elevate and enable promising practices dedicated to identifying and removing barriers to affordable housing production and preservation, while preventing displacement;Institutionalize state and local analysis and implementation of effective, equitable, and resilient approaches to affordable housing production and preservation;Provide technical assistance to help communities better fulfill the Consolidated Plan’s requirement of identifying barriers to affordable housing and implementing solutions to address these barriers;Affirmatively further fair housing by addressing and removing barriers that perpetuate segregation, inhibit access to well-resourced areas of opportunity for protected class groups and vulnerable populations, and concentrate affordable housing in under-resourced areas; andFacilitate collaboration and harness innovative approaches from jurisdictions, researchers, advocates, and stakeholders.HUD will prioritize applicants that demonstrate: (1) progress and a commitment to overcoming local barriers to facilitate the increase in affordable housing production and preservation, primarily by having enacted improved laws and regulations that HUD reasonably expects to preserve or produce new housing units; and (2) an acute need for housing affordable to households with incomes below 100 percent of the area median income. If applicable, proposals should also explain how the funds will be used to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing by expanding access to housing opportunities in well-resourced areas for protected class groups. HUD will also prioritize applicants that demonstrate a commitment and ability to identify and remove barriers to: (1) expanding affordable housing in a manner that promotes desegregation; (2) expanding affordable housing in well-resourced areas of opportunity for protected class groups that have systematically been denied equitable access to such areas; or (3) deconcentrating affordable housing and increasing housing choice. HUD encourages applications that incorporate a discussion of key barriers related to land-use regulations, permitting, or related procedural issues. HUD further encourages applicants to outline and discuss how their proposed activities will advance equity, locate affordable accessible housing near transit and bolster access to services and opportunities, increase community resilience and mitigate the effects of natural and environmental hazards, and develop and preserve affordable housing in accordance with input from community members and other stakeholders.As with all CDBG assistance, the priority is to serve low- and moderate-income people.PRO Housing grantees must administer the PRO Housing grant in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, which means taking meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, to overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics. Specifically, affirmatively furthering fair housing means taking meaningful actions that, taken together, address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunities, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'https://', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nKimberly Nash\nCDBG-PROHousing@hud.gov\n\nCDBG-PROHousing@hud.gov'}"

The purpose of FMA Swift Current is to reduce or eliminate the flood risk to NFIP-participating communities and repetitive flood damage to structures and buildings insured by the NFIP following a flood-related disaster event, and to enhance community flood resilience within NFIP-participating communities. It does so by providing funding for mitigation opportunities immediately after a flood disaster event with the aim of delivering mitigation outcomes.  \n\nSwift Current is a grant opportunity under the FMA grant program. The FMA grant program makes federal funds available to states, U.S. territories, federally recognized tribal governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and within NFIP-participating communities. It does so with a recognition of the growing flood hazards associated with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect to flooding. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future.\n\nProjects or initiatives that are eligible for funding under this announcement may or may not involve Geospatial (GIS) issues.\n\nApplicants can submit applications for this funding opportunity through FEMA Grants Outcomes (GO).

The purpose of FMA Swift Current is to reduce or eliminate the flood risk to NFIP-participating communities and repetitive flood damage to structures and buildings insured by the NFIP following a flood-related disaster event, and to enhance community flood resilience within NFIP-participating communities. It does so by providing funding for mitigation opportunities immediately after a flood disaster event with the aim of delivering mitigation outcomes as quickly as possible.  \n\nSwift Current is a grant opportunity under the FMA grant program. The FMA grant program makes federal funds available to states, U.S. territories, federally recognized Tribal governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and within NFIP-participating communities. It does so with a recognition of the growing flood hazards associated with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect to flooding. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future.\n\nProjects or initiatives that are eligible for funding under this announcement may or may not involve Geospatial (GIS) issues.\n\nAmendment #1 edits the Fiscal Year 2023 Flood Mitigation Assistance Swift Current Notice of Funding Opportunity to reflect change language and additional language based on feedback and questions from FEMA Regions and eligible applicants activated for Swift Current. \n\n\n.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'mtegrants@fema.dhs.gov', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nmtegrants@fema.dhs.gov\n\nmtegrants@fema.dhs.gov'}"

PDS only considers proposals received in response to the Annual Program Statement, and Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOS) posted on Grants.gov and the Embassy website.\n  The Embassy invites proposals from qualified individuals and organizations for programs that strengthen cultural ties between the United States and Armenia, including cultural and exchange programs that highlight shared values and promote bilateral cooperation. All programs must include an American cultural element, or connection with American expert(s), organization(s) or institution(s) in a specific field that will promote increased understanding of U.S. policy, culture, and perspectives. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis and awarded pending funding availability. This Annual Program Statement outlines our funding priorities, strategic themes, and procedures for submitting proposals. Please follow all instructions below carefully.\n  Priority Program Areas\n  1.     Reinforce U.S.-Armenian Shared Values, by funding proposals that support human rights, social inclusion (including supporting integration of displaced persons), youth outreach, gender equity, and women’s empowerment.\n2.     Strengthen U.S.-Armenia Cultural and Educational Ties, by funding proposals that promote U.S. culture, including music, dance, arts, film, sports, and education, and bring together U.S. and Armenian artists, educators, and other experts together to collaborate and support artistic and cultural projects that advance human rights, equity and social inclusion, youth outreach, and women’s empowerment.\n3.     Advance Shared Prosperity, by funding proposals that foster economic empowerment, resilience, and shared prosperity through STEM education and entrepreneurship initiatives, particularly for youth and other underserved audiences, including women.\n4.     Advance Regional and Global Security, by funding proposals that support reconciliation, peace-building, and lasting partnerships between the people of Armenia and Azerbaijan, and normalization of relations between the people of Armenia and Turkey, including plans for continued cooperation after the project ends.\n5.     Develop Media Capacity and Expand English Language Opportunities, by funding proposals that advance media literacy, train journalists, and expand English language learning and training opportunities for journalists, students, and youth.\n6.     Strengthen Democracy and Civil Society, by funding proposals that encourage transparency and accountability in governance, foster civic engagement and reforms, and promote democracy, rule of law, and civic education.

The program will fund P50 SPORE grants to support state-of-the-art investigator-initiated translational research that will contribute to improved prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of an organ-specific cancer or a highly related group of cancers. For the purpose of this FOA, a group of highly related cancers are those that are derived from the same organ system, such as gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine, head and neck, and other cancers. Other programmatically appropriate groups of cancers may include those centered around a common biological mechanism critical for promoting tumorigenesis and/or cancer progression in organ sites that belong to different organ systems. For example, a SPORE may focus on cancers caused by the same infectious agent or cancers promoted and sustained by dysregulation of a common signaling pathway. In addition, a SPORE may focus on cross-cutting themes such as pediatric cancers or cancer health disparities. The research supported through this program must be translational and must stem from research on human biology using cellular, molecular, structural, biochemical, and/or genetic experimental approaches. SPORE projects must have the goal of reaching a translational human endpoint within the project period of the grant.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-284.html', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNIH Grants Information\ngrantsinfo@nih.gov\n\nSee Section VII.

The goals of the Catalysis program are to increase fundamental understanding in catalytic engineering science and to advance the development of catalysts and catalytic reactions that are beneficial to society. Research should focus on critical challenges and opportunities in both new and proven catalysis technologies. Areas of emphasis may include novel catalyst compositions, structures, operating environment, data science tools, theory, and modeling – preferably in various combinations as dictated by the specific reaction and related knowledge and technology gaps. Target applications include fuels, specialty and bulk chemicals, environmental catalysis, biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals, greenhouse gas mitigation, recycling of waste materials, generation of solar hydrogen, as well as efficient routes to energy utilization. Heterogeneous catalysis represents the main thrust of the program. Proposals related to both gas-solid and liquid-solid heterogeneous catalysis are welcome, as are proposals that incorporate concepts from homogeneous catalysis. Recent research trends have highlighted the need for evaluation of catalyst performance and properties under working conditions, especially as supported by advanced in situ and in operando characterization methods. Catalyst synthesizability and stability present additional research opportunities given the harsh operating environments of many catalytic processes. Topic areas of particular interest include:\nEnergy-related catalysis, utilizing renewable or sustainable energy in lieu of thermal, fossil fuel-based technologies, especially applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals, and also including fuel cell catalysis.\nCatalysis aimed at closing the carbon cycle (especially conversion of carbon dioxide, methane, and natural gas to fuels and chemical intermediates).\nHeterogeneous catalytic alternatives to traditionally non-catalytic or homogeneous reaction processes, as well as new catalyst designs for established catalytic processes.\nEnvironmental catalysis focused on mitigating both air and water pollutants, and supporting energy-efficient upcycling of waste materials to higher-value products.\nCatalytic remediation of feedstocks, process streams, products, or effluents.\nCommercially scalable methods of catalyst synthesis, including durable, poison-resistant, and easily regenerable catalyst formulations and designs.\nNew catalytic materials and architectures (especially those substituting earth-abundant materials for precious and noble metal catalysts).\nBasic understanding of catalytic materials, reaction pathways, kinetics, and surface reaction mechanisms.\nAdvanced tools for catalyst characterization and theoretical/computational catalysis.\nProposals that deal with new catalytic materials, especially when viewed in light of the inherent complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, will be enhanced by including plans to assess: 1) reproducibility and repeatability of data, 2) stability under realistic operating conditions including start-up and shut-down cycles, 3) performance relative to standard or well-known reference materials, and 4) quantitative, well-accepted measures of catalyst activity, selectivity, and catalytic efficiency, such as turnover frequencies, quantum and/or photon yields of photocatalysts, Faradaic efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, and detailed product analyses and mass balances for the targeted application. NOTE: Proposals that focus on 1) molecular or homogeneous catalysis, 2) the surface science of catalysis, 3) photo redox catalysis, 4) catalytic organic synthesis reactions, and/or 5) fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications of catalysis may be more appropriately submitted to the Chemical Catalysis program.(CHE 6884) in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals focused on biocatalytic processes, including proposals focusing on enzyme engineering, cellular and biomolecular processes, should be submitted to the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program (CBET 1491). If the proposal focuses on reaction engineering aspects of catalytic processes, submit to the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program (CBET 1403). Projects that are interdisciplinary in nature may be jointly funded with other CBET and NSF programs.

The goal of theProcess Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamicsprogram is to advance fundamental engineering research on the rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions, systems engineering, and molecular thermodynamics as they relate to the design and optimization of chemical reactors and the production of specialized materials that have important impacts on society. The program supports the development of advanced optimization and control algorithms for chemical processes, molecular and multi-scale modeling of complex chemical systems, fundamental studies on molecular thermodynamics, and the integration of these methods and concepts into the design of novel chemical products and manufacturing processes. This program supports sustainable chemical manufacturing research on the development of energy-efficientchemical processes and environmentally-friendly chemical products through concurrent chemical product/process design methods.Sustainability is also enhanced by research that promotes the electrification of the chemical process industries over current thermally-activated processes. Proposals should focus on:\nChemical reaction engineering: This area encompasses the interaction of transport phenomena and kinetics in reactive systems and the use of this knowledge in the design of chemical reactors.Research areas include(1) development of novel reactor designs, such as catalytic and membrane reactors, micro-reactors, chemical vapor and atomic layer deposition systems, (2) studies of reactions in supercritical fluids, (3) novel reaction activation techniques such as atmospheric pressure plasmas (which may be submitted under the ECLIPSE meta-program) and microwave radiation, (4) design of multifunctional and intensified systems, such as chemical-factory/lab-on-a-chip concepts, (5) nanoparticle nucleation, growth, and surface functionalization, and (6) biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals.The program also supports new approaches that enable the design of modular chemical manufacturing systems such as distributed hydrogen and ammonia production processes.\nProcess design, optimization, and control: This area encompasses process systems science, including the development of process modeling, design, control and optimization theory and algorithms; process development proposals are not appropriate for this program.High-priority research topics include process intensification, modular process systems, smart manufacturing, large-scale carbon dioxide capture and conversion, computational tools (including those based on quantum computing methods) enabling advanced chemical manufacturing, real-time optimization and control of large-scale chemical systems with quantitative sustainability metrics, machine learning, and optimization of enterprise-wide processes involving planning, scheduling, and real-time control to create resilient supply chains.\nReactive polymer processing: Program scope in this area is limited to research that integrates synthesis and processing to engineer specific nanoscale structures and compositions to tune the macroscopic scale properties of polymers, such as their ability to biodegrade or to be recycled. The focus is on reactive processes that address these environmental concerns while producing tailor-made macromolecular materials.\nMolecular thermodynamics: This area focuses on fundamental research that combines principles of classical thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and atomistic-scale simulations to improve chemical processing and to facilitate synthesis of novel functional materials such as catalysts, polymers, solvents, and colloids. Topics include fundamental studies on self- and directed-assembly of nanoscale-level patterned polymer films, machine-learning methods to predict structure-property relationships, large-ensemble molecular dynamics simulations, simulation of peptide self-assembly and protein interactions, and behavior of multiphase and reactive systems under nanoscale confinement. The ultimate goal of research supported by this program is to enable the development of more efficient chemical processes, improve environmental sustainability and water quality, and design functional materials with tailored properties.\nInnovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered.However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.

SoS:DCI welcomes proposals to conduct research at the individual, organizational and institutional levels or from micro, meso and macro scales and complex system levels. SoS:DCI encourages multiple disciplinary perspectives, interdisciplinary research and diverse methodological approaches in the pursuit of new knowledge to advance the science of science and evidence-based policy making. With these goals in mind, proposals should:\nDraw from and advance theory, knowledge and frameworks on the science of science.\nDevelop models, data, indicators and associated analytical tools that constitute and enable transformative advances rather than incremental change.\nProvide credible rigorous assessments of the proposed project’s impact and social and policy implications.\nInclude robust data management plans with the goal of advancing open science and increasing public access to usable, valid and reliable scientific materials.\nOf particular interest are proposals with the potential to strengthen America’s global leadership in science and increase national competitiveness across a broad range of domains. These include proposals that analyze strategies for strengthening and diversifying the scientific workforce, as well as ways to cultivate high-impact discovery across sectors.The program strongly encourages convergent research and collaboration. In addition to intellectual merit, the program strongly encourages potential PIs to carefully consider the broader impacts of their work. The broader impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired policy outcomes.The Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate has released additional guidance on broader impacts for SBE proposals. The SoS:DCI program places a high priority on broadening participation in the sciences. It encourages participation from junior faculty, women and members of historically underrepresented groups, as well as proposals from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), Research Undergraduate Institutions (RUIs) and institutions in EPSCoR states. The program also encourages diverse and inclusive research teams. SoS:DCI supports the following types of proposals:\nStandard Research Grants and Grants for Collaborative Research\nA Science of Science Approach to Analyzing and Innovating the Biomedical Research Enterprise (SoS:BIO)\nConference Grants\nSoS:DCI also participates in certain specialized funding opportunities through NSF’s cross-cutting and cross-directorate activities.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Program Desccription PD-19-125Y', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

It is expected that funds obtained through this program will be used to support untenured faculty or research scientists (or equivalent) in their first three years in a primary academic position after the PhD, but not more than six years after completion of their PhD. Applicants for this program may not yet have received any other grants or contracts in the PI role from any department, agency, or institution of the federal government, including from the CAREER program or any other program, post-PhD, regardless of the size of the grant or contract, with certain exceptions as noted below. Serving as co-PI, Senior Personnel, Postdoctoral Fellow, or other Fellow does not count against this eligibility rule. Importantly, the CRII program seeks to provide essential resources to enable early-career PIs to launch their research careers. This funding opportunity also aims to broaden the engagement of investigators in CISE research and therefore is limited to investigators that are either (1) affiliated with an Institution of Higher Education that is not a ""very high research activity"" R1 institution (according to the Carnegie Classification https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/) or (2) non-profit non-academic institutions. Faculty at undergraduate and two-year institutions may use funds to support undergraduate students, and may optionally use the additional RUI designation (which requires inclusion of a RUI Certification and RUI Impact Statement) -- see https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5518 for additional information.

Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance, see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1). The date shown of 3/28/2025 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-24 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-25 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-24 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years.\n\nProposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package.\n  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024.\n  This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)” from that same page.

In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024.\n  This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements.

On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. \n  Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs.

This transformation offers great promise for improved wellbeing and prosperity but poses significant challenges at the complex intersection of technology and society. The goal of the NSF Smart and Connected Communities (S&CC) program solicitation is to accelerate the creation of the scientific and engineering foundations that will enable smart and connected communities to bring about new levels of economic opportunity and growth, safety and security, health and wellness, accessibility and inclusivity, and overall quality of life. For the purposes of this solicitation, communities are defined as having geographically-delineated boundaries—such as towns, cities, counties, neighborhoods, community districts, rural areas, and tribal regions—consisting of various populations, with the structure and ability to engage in meaningful ways with proposed research activities. A “smart and connected community” is, in turn, defined as a community that synergistically integrates intelligent technologies with the natural and built environments, including infrastructure, to improve the social, economic, and environmental well-being of those who live, work, learn, or travel within it. The S&CC program encourages researchers to work with community stakeholders to identify and define challenges they are facing, enabling those challenges to motivate use-inspired research questions. For this solicitation, community stakeholders may include some or all of the following: residents, neighborhood or community groups, nonprofit or philanthropic organizations, businesses, as well as municipal organizations such as libraries, museums, educational institutions, public works departments, and health and social services agencies. The S&CC program supports integrative research that addresses fundamental technological and social science dimensions of smart and connected communities and pilots solutions together with communities. Importantly, this program is interested in projects that consider the sustainability of the research outcomes beyond the life of the project, including the scalability and transferability of the proposed solutions. This S&CC solicitation will support research projects in the following categories:\nS&CC Integrative Research Grants (SCC-IRG) Tracks 1 and 2.

Proposals that deal with engineered surfaces forcarrying out chemical or biochemical reactions or separations should be directed to ENG/CBETInterfacial Engineeringprogram.Proposals dealing mainly with particle synthesis may be more suitable forthe ENG/CMMIAdvanced Manufacturingprogram or the Division of Materials Research (DMR) in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) Directorate. Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered; however, prior to submission, it is recommended that the PI contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review. INFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS Proposals should address the novelty and/orpotentially transformative natureof the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research.The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal. The duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of PI time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger).

The goal of theEnvironmental Sustainabilityprogram is to promote sustainable engineered systems that support human well-being and that are also compatible with sustaining natural (environmental) systems. These systems provide ecological services vital for human survival. Research efforts supported by the program typically consider long time horizons and may incorporate contributions from the social sciences and ethics. The program supports engineering research that seeks to balance society's need to provide ecological protection and maintain stable economic conditions. There are five principal general research areas that are supported.\nCircular Bioeconomy Engineering:This area includes research that enables sustainable societal use of food, energy, water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and materials, with the reduction and eventual elimination of fossil fuel combustion that lacks carbon capture. The program encourages research that helps build the raw material basis for the functioning of society principally on biomass, drawing heavily on sustainable agriculture and forestry. Additionally, material flows must reduce or preferably eliminate waste, with an emphasis on closed-loop or “circular” processing.\nIndustrial ecology:Topics of interest include advancements in modeling such as life cycle assessment, materials flow analysis, net energy analysis, input/output economic models, and novel metrics for measuring sustainable systems. Innovations in industrial ecology are encouraged.\nGreen engineering:Research is encouraged to advance the sustainability of manufacturing processes, green buildings, and infrastructure. Many programs in the Engineering Directorate support research in environmentally benign manufacturing or chemical processes. The Environmental Sustainability program supports research that would affect more than one chemical or manufacturing process or that takes a systems or holistic approach to green engineering for infrastructure or green buildings. Improvements in distribution and collection systems that will advance smart growth strategies and ameliorate effects of growth are research areas that are supported by Environmental Sustainability. Innovations in management of storm water, recycling and reuse of drinking water, and other green engineering techniques to support sustainability may also be fruitful areas for research.\nEcological engineering:Proposals should focus on the engineering aspects of restoring ecological function to natural systems. Engineering research in the enhancement of natural capital to foster sustainable development is encouraged.\nEarth systems engineering:Earth systems engineering considers aspects of large-scale engineering research that involve mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to climate change, and other global concerns.\nAll proposed research should be driven by engineering principles, and be presented explicitly in an environmental sustainability context. Proposals should include involvement in engineering research of at least one graduate student, as well as undergraduates.

TheEBMS programsupports fundamental and transformative research in the following areas of biomedical engineering:\nDevelopmentof validated models (living or computational) of healthy and pathological tissues and organ systems that can support improved fundamental understanding of these systems or that could be applied in the future for development and testing of medical interventions;\nDesignand validation of systems that integrate living and non-living componentsfor improved understanding of physiology that could be applied in the future for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment ofdisease or injury;\nDesign and subsequent application of technologies andtools toinvestigate fundamental physiological and pathophysiological processes;\nAdvancedbiomanufacturing of three-dimensional tissues and organs; and\nApplication of engineering tools and principles, including mathematical modeling, to quantitatively study the immune system in health and disease and to develop techniques for controlling and modulating a host’s immune response to challenges such as infectious diseases, cancer, implants, autoimmune disorders, wounds, etc.\nThe long-term impact of the projects can be related to effective disease diagnosis and/or treatment, or improved health care delivery. However, immediate goals should focus on improved fundamental understanding of cell and tissue function in normal or pathological conditions and advancing biomedical engineering. Innovative proposals outside of these specific areas of biomedical engineering may be considered.However, prior to submission, it is strongly recommended that the PIs contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review. Related programs also fund biomedical engineering research, and PIs are encouraged to examine these to find the appropriate program for submission. The EBMS program does not support proposals having as their central theme drug design and delivery, the development of biomedical devices that do not include a living biological component, or thedevelopment of animal models of disease.For consideration by the EBMS program, proposals that advance the design of tools or technologies should also apply those technologies to advance knowledge in biomedical science. NSF does not support clinical trials; however, feasibility studies involving human volunteers may be supported if appropriate to the project objectives. Projects with a central focus on design or optimization of a device, material, algorithm, or process alone without exploring new fundamental biomedical science are not appropriate for the EBMS program. Furthermore, although research on biomaterials, cellular biomechanics, manufacturing systems, or algorithm/device design may constitute a part of the proposed studies, such research can be more appropriately targeted to other NSF programs:\nProjects that aim to improve protein engineering or cellular biomanufacturing - either manufacturing cells or cell-derived products - should consider the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering (CBE) program.\nProjects that focus on the development and application of microphysiological systems that model functional recovery related to a specific human disability or injury mechanism should consider the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering (DARE) program.\nBiomaterials-focused projects should consider the Biomaterials (BMAT) program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).\nCellular and tissue biomechanics projects should consider the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).\nManufacturing systems proposals should consider the Advanced Manufacturing(AM) program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).\nInnovative research on signal processing techniques or dynamic biosensing systems should consider the Communications, Circuits, and Sensing-Systems (CCSS) program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).\nInnovative research on novel devices based on the principles of electronics, optics and photonics, optoelectronics, magnetics, opto- and electromechanics, electromagnetics, and related physical phenomena, also including material-device interaction, should consider the Electronics, Photonics and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).\nINFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS Proposals should address the novelty and/orpotentially transformative natureof the proposed work compared to previous work in the field. Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact of success in the research on society and/or industry. The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal. The duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of PI time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger).

In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics.

Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited.

Recent research shows that science scholars who are underrepresented in STEM produce higher rates of scientific novelty, yet they do not persist in the systems where the innovation is created (Hofstra et al. 2020). Because the geosciences continue to lag other STEM fields in creating a diverse community of researchers, scholars, and practitioners, disruptive strategies and evidence-based practices are needed to recruit and specifically retain individuals who historically have not been included in geoscience education, research and careers. The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) seeks to support activities that will develop unique approaches or bring to scale current efforts to increase and sustain the inclusion of individuals from diverse backgrounds in the geoscience education and research community. Proposals that will address elements in the following two areas are encouraged: Professional Development. GEO encourages projects that will develop efforts and training that focus on the creation of BAJEDI (Belonging Accessibility Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion) leaders through scaling of model professional development (PD) programs, identifying barriers that exist within academia and/or the geosciences that prevent the development of diversity champions, and the employment of strategies that will create and sustain cohorts of diversity leaders to maximize collective impact in the geoscience ecosystem.\nExamples of focus areas for PD centered proposals could include: 1) training in BAJEDI for graduate students and postdocs who will soon be on the job market, 2) creation of curriculum and standards for safe, equitable and inclusive education and research practices, 3) development of guidance that would assist geoscience academic and research units in developing or implementing BAJEDI plans, and 4) identification and fostering of practices related to the valuation of BAJEDI leaders and their activities in institutional promotion systems.\nGeoscience Capacity Building at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). With the recognition that Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) operate with intentionality and holistic support of students (NASEM 2019), GEO also welcomes proposals that envision new efforts to create educational or degree granting geoscience programs at MSIs or scale existing geoscience programs into graduate programs at MSIs with the following elements in mind:\nConsideration of the necessary steps to create or scale an educational or degree granting geoscience program through partnerships and collaborations, with an emphasis on collaborative infrastructure as defined under the NSF INCLUDES Program.\nDevelopment of pilot bridge programs (high school to undergraduate, undergraduate to graduate and graduate to workforce) to grow the pool of potential geoscience program majors at MSIs and prepare them to be geoscience professionals.\nIdentification and reduction of barriers (e.g., grants infrastructure or institutional policies) that may hinder the creation and sustainability of educational and degree granting geoscience programs at MSIs.\nCreation of a coordinating unit to assist in supporting or building grants management infrastructure at MSIs.\nWhen developing proposals, the PI team should acknowledge the need for increased engagement from social and behavioral science experts to address issues related to BAJEDI in the geosciences and include these best practices and experts in proposed projects. Proposals could also focus on the dissemination of information on lessons learned from related activities (e.g., GOLD, NSF INCLUDES National Network, etc.) to the geoscience community, and encourage new opportunities for collaboration in the community and across other NSF Broadening Participation Programs. Review Information Competitive funding requests will explicitly describe and demonstrate their alignment and/or connections to the mission and goals of NSF’s GOLD Program.

Environmental engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies chemical, biological, and physical scientific principles to protect human and ecological health. The goal of the Environmental Engineering program is tosupport potentially transformative fundamental research that applies scientific and engineering principles to 1) prevent, minimize, or re-use solid, liquid, and gaseous discharges of pollution to soil, water, and air by closing resource loops or through other measures; 2) mitigate the ecological and human-health impacts of such releases by smart/adaptive/reactive amendments or manipulation of the environment, and 3) remediate polluted environments through engineered chemical, biological, and/or geo-physical processes. Integral to achieving these goals is a fundamental understanding of the transport and biogeochemical reactivity of pollutants in the environment. Therefore, research on environmental micro/biology, environmental chemistry, and environmental geophysics may be relevant providing the research has a clear objective of protecting human and ecological health. Major areas of interest include (but are not limited to):\nBuilding afuture without pollution or waste: Investigation of innovative biogeochemical processes that prevent or minimize the production of waste; waste valorization and other research that will lead to new technologies toextract resources from waste streams to close the resource loop.\nSustainable supply and protection ofwater: Investigation of innovative biogeochemical processesthat remove, biologically or chemically transform, and/or prevent therelease of contaminants in surface and groundwater; innovative processesfor recovery of water, nutrients, and other resources from wastewater,saline water, or brines; innovative approaches to smart and adaptive management of surface water, groundwater, and urban watersheds and storm water to maintain/improve quality and prevent downstream impacts from nutrients and other water constituents.\nEnvironmentalchemistry, fate, and transport of nutrients and contaminants of emergingconcern in air, water, soils, and sediments:Investigation of transport and biogeochemical reactivity in theenvironment; environmental forensics to identify sources and reaction pathways; field- and laboratory scale experimental research that bridgesgaps between data and predictions from molecular, continuum, and field-scale modeling.\nEnvironmentalengineering of the built environment: Research to understand the biogeochemical reactivity of the builtenvironment with the goal of enhancing and improving human and ecological health; research that will lead to new technologies to improve outdoor and indoor air quality; research to understand how drinking water and wastewater chemical characteristics and microbial community structure impact or are affected by water quality and human health.\nNOTE: Proposals with a scientific focus on chemical or physical separation processes (for example, materials or processes for reverse osmosis, membrane distillation, and hypo-filtration) should be submitted to the Interfacial Engineering program (CBET 1417). Proposals that seek to advance fundamental and quantitative understanding of the behaviors of nanomaterials and nanosystems should be submitted to the Nanoscale Interactions program (CBET 1179). Proposals focused on in vitro molecular-level environmental chemistry research should be submitted to Environmental Chemical Sciences program (CHE-ECS 6882). Proposals focusing on industrial ecology, green engineering, and ecological/earth systems engineering should be submitted to the Environmental Sustainability program (CBET 7643). Proposals whose main research focus is on materials development, sensors, or environmental monitoring that do not seek to understand biogeochemical reactivity mechanisms or treatment efficiency are not encouraged and may be returned without review. Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the PI contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review. INFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS Proposals should address the novelty and/orpotentially transformative natureof the proposed work compared to previous work in the field. Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research. The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal. The duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of PI time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the “What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)” link towards the bottom of this page. Faculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged. Award duration is five years. The submission deadline for Engineering CAREER proposals is in July every year. Learn more in the CAREER program description. Proposals for Conferences, Workshops, and Supplements: PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss their requests with the program director before submission of the proposal. Grants forRapid Response Research(RAPID)andEArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research(EAGER)are also considered when appropriate.Please note that proposals of these types must be discussed with the program director before submission.Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)proposals that integrate fundamental research with translational results and are consistent with the application areas of interest to each program are also encouraged.Please note that RAPID, EAGER, and GOALI proposals can be submitted anytime during the year. Details about RAPID, EAGER, and GOALI are available in the Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide(PAPPG), Part 1, Chapter II, Section E: Types of Proposals.

Transformers are scientists ready to tackle the challenges the nation and world are facing due to climate change. This opportunity will adopt the spirit of multiple directives for the research community; for example, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report on Earth System Scienceand the Advisory Committee for Environmental Research and Education report on Engaged Research. These directives call on the research enterprise to support the building of a robust scientific workforce ready to work with communities in addressing societal challenges. Through convergence research approaches to address societal challenges, the transdisciplinary researchers engaged in FORECAST will foster community resilience and the translation of research outcomes for societal benefits, as well as gain a broader understanding of the governmental context related to these issues. A new generation of scientists trained in ""engaged research"" will be expected to have a national impact in communities that may be disproportionately affected by climate change impacts. The program will build cohorts of innovative scholars from the full spectrum of diverse talent at emerging research institutions to include groups historically excluded in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Participants, who are senior students in undergraduate programs and students who are in master\'s degree programs, will be supported through intentional professional development activities. FORECAST participants must be US citizens or permanent residents. FORECAST proposals will fall into three categories: Track 1, Track 2, and FORECAST Planning grants. Track 1 will support one Coordination Hub, to coordinate support for rising seniors from emerging research institutions (ERIs) or historically excluded and underserved groups as part of a national cohort to participate in structured professional development opportunities. Track 2 projects will support cohorts of Master\'s degree students at ERIs. Mentorship and capacity building should be central to the cohort approach. FORECAST Planning grant proposals will build capacity at ERI institutions and with the appropriate partners to undertake the activities necessary to establish a future FORECAST track 2 cohort.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 24-558', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

The NSF ADVANCE program goal is to broaden the implementation of evidence-based systemic change strategies that promote equity for STEM2 faculty in academic workplaces and the academic profession. The NSF ADVANCE program provides grants to enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and to mitigate the systemic factors that create inequities in the academic profession and workplaces. Systemic (or organizational) inequities may exist in areas such as policy and practice as well as in organizational culture and climate. For example, practices in academic departments that result in the inequitable allocation of service or teaching assignments may impede research productivity, delay advancement, and create a culture of differential treatment and rewards. Similarly, policies and procedures that do not mitigate implicit bias in hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions could lead to women and racial and ethnic minorities being evaluated less favorably, perpetuating historical under-participation in STEM academic careers and contributing to an academic climate that is not inclusive. All NSF ADVANCE proposals are expected to use intersectional approaches in the design of systemic change strategies in recognition that gender, race and ethnicity do not exist in isolation from each other and from other categories of social identity. The solicitation includes four funding tracks: Institutional Transformation (IT), Adaptation, Partnership, and Catalyst, in support of the NSF ADVANCE program goal to broaden the implementation of systemic strategies that promote equity for STEM faculty in academic workplaces and the academic profession.\nThe Institutional Transformation (IT) track is designed to support the development, implementation, and evaluation of innovative systemic change strategies that promote gender equity for STEM faculty within an institution of higher education.\nThe Adaptation track is designed to support the work to adapt, implement, and evaluate evidence-based systemic change strategies that have been shown to promote gender equity for STEM faculty in academic workplaces and the academic profession. Adaptation projects can either: 1) support the adaptation of evidence-based systemic change strategies to promote equity for STEM faculty within an institution of higher education; or 2) facilitate national or regional STEM disciplinary transformation by adapting evidence-based systemic change strategies to non-profit, non-academic organizations.\nThe Partnership track is designed to support the work to facilitate the broader adaptation of gender equity and systemic change strategies. Partnership projects are expected to result in national or regional transformation in STEM academic workplaces and the academic profession and demonstrate significant reach. Partnership projects can focus on the transformation of institutions and organizations and/or the transformation within one or more STEM disciplines.\nThe Catalyst track is designed to broaden the types of IHEs that are able to undertake data collection and institutional self-assessment work to identify systemic gender inequities impacting their STEM faculty so that these can be addressed by the institution.\nPlease note that NSF ADVANCE does not provide fellowships, research, or travel grants to individual students, postdoctoral researchers, or faculty to pursue STEM degrees or research. Undergraduate STEM opportunities can be found at stemundergrads.science.gov and graduate STEM opportunities at stemgradstudents.science.gov.\n[1]Building the Future Investing in Innovation and Discovery: NSF Strategic Plan 2018-2022. https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18045/nsf18045.pdf.\n[2] All the STEM fields supported by NSF are supported by the ADVANCE program including the learning, social, behavioral, and economic sciences.

This amendment announces several changes to this program element: A final science gaps list will be posted under other documents on the NSPIRES page for this program element no later than November 30th, 2024. Alignment with these science gaps will be considered in the LPS evaluation (see Sections 1.1 and 3); proposals will be evaluated using dual-anonymous peer review, see Section 2.8; and numerous other clarifications to the text. New text is in bold and deleted text is struck through. The due dates remain unchanged: Mandatory NOIs are due January 17, 2025, and proposals are due March 20, 2025.\n  Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package.\n  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited.

See the full posting on NSPIRES for details.\n\nProposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package.\n  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024.\n  This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call.

This program also strengthens both empirical and theoretical economic analysis as well as the methods for rigorous research on economic behavior. It supports research in almost every area of economics, including econometrics, economic history, environmental economics, finance, industrial organization, international economics, labor economics, macroeconomics, mathematical economics, and public finance. The Economics program welcomes proposals for individual or multi-investigator research projects, doctoral dissertation improvement awards, conferences, symposia, experimental research, data collection and dissemination, computer equipment and other instrumentation, and research experience for undergraduates. The program places a high priority on interdisciplinary research. Investigators are encouraged to submit proposals of joint interest to the Economics Program and other NSF programs and NSF initiative areas. The program places a high priority on broadening participation and encourages proposals from junior faculty, women, other underrepresented minorities, Research Undergraduate Institutions, and EPSCoR states. The program also funds conferences and interdisciplinary research that strengthens links among economics and the other social and behavioral sciences as well as mathematics and statistics. The Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DDRIG) funding opportunity is designed to improve the quality of dissertation research.DDRIG proposals are submitted by a faculty member on behalf of the graduate student. DDRIG awards provide funds for items not normally available through the student's university such as enabling doctoral students to undertake significant data-gathering projects and to conduct field research in settings away from their campus.

The use of the term ""historically underrepresented minority"" reflects language from Congress, and in the context of the AGEP program, the AGEP populations are defined as STEM doctoral candidates, postdoctoral scholars and faculty, who are African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The terms for these racial and ethnic populations are derived from the US government\'s guidance for federal statistics and administrative reporting. At the graduate student level, only doctoral candidates are included because they have greater potential to enter a faculty position within the project duration time frame.\nImproving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty, educating America’s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, seeks to fund grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace. The AGEP program goal to increase the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty is bolstered by the National Science Board’s Vision 2030: Vision for the Future.3 Systemic and organizational inequities may exist in areas such as policy and practice as well as in institutional, departmental, laboratory and classroom culture and climate. AGEP proposals may address, for example, practices in academic departments that result in the inequitable allocation of service or teaching assignments which may impede research productivity, delay career advancement, and create a culture of differential treatment and rewards. Similarly, policies and procedures that fail to mitigate implicit bias in hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions could lead to people who are members of AGEP populations being evaluated less favorably, perpetuating historical under-participation in STEM academic careers and contributing to an academic climate that is not inclusive. All AGEP Alliances are expected to engage similar institutions of higher education (IHE) to work collaboratively and use intersectional approaches in the design, implementation, and evaluation of systemic change strategies. The collaborating IHEs must be similar to each other based on such variables as Carnegie classification, geographic location and student and/or faculty demographic characteristics. This solicitation includes three funding tracks that all support the AGEP program goal. All tracks require collaborative IHE teams to use an intersectional lens as they address systemic and institutional change strategies at IHEs to promote equity for AGEP populations.\nThe AGEP Institutional Transformation Alliance (ITA) track is designed to support the development, implementation, and evaluation of innovative systemic and institutional change strategies that promote equity for AGEP populations, within similar IHEs. ITAs will create permanent policy and practice changes that advance AGEP populations, and the project work is expected to be sustained after NSF funding expires. Please note that a preliminary proposal to the ITA track is required, and that at least one of the institutions submitting must first have or have had an AGEP Catalyst Alliance. The proposing IHEs represented in the preliminary ITA proposal must be the same collaborating IHEs who will plan to submit a full ITA proposal, if invited by NSF to submit the full ITA. Please read the full solicitation for details about ITA Preliminary and Full proposal submissions that begin in FY2022.\nThe AGEP Faculty Career Pathways Alliance Model (FC-PAM) track is intended to support the development, implementation, evaluation, and institutionalization of Alliance models that will advance AGEP populations, within similar IHEs. The FC-PAM collaborators must also self-study into how socio-cultural, economic, structural, leadership and institutional variables affect the formation of the FC-PAM Alliance, and the strategies or interventions the collaborators implement to advance the AGEP populations.A Letter of Intent (LOI) is required ONLY for IHEs that plan to submit an FC-PAM collaborative proposal, and only one LOI is needed for the collaborating research institutions that plan to submit the FC-PAM proposal.The FC-PAM track will only be available in FY2021-FY2022 and it will be discontinued thereafter.\nThe AGEP Catalyst Alliance (ACA) track supports the design and implementation of one or more organizational self-assessment(s) to collect and analyze data that will identify inequities affecting the AGEP populations; pilot equity strategies as appropriate; and develop a five-year equity strategic plan for the AGEP populations. The ACA is meant as a facilitator grant to help similar IHEs generate the foundational work necessary to initiate an ITA project.\n[1] Building the Future Investing in Innovation and Discovery: NSF Strategic Plan 2018-2022.

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): “(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that— (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.” ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. § 16538. The FOA and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.” Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”)1 should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). Program Overview: The Nuclear Energy Waste Transmutation Optimized Now (NEWTON) program will support the research and development of technologies that enable the transmutation of used nuclear fuel (UNF) to alleviate the impact of storage in permanent disposal facilities. This program seeks to fund the development of novel technologies that increase the overall capacity factor, power output, and efficiency of particle generation systems (including but not limited to proton, neutron, and/or photon), by reducing beam trip magnitude and duration (referred to as loss of beam). Additional technologies will focus on increasing the throughput of transmutation by developing target materials that maximize transmutation rates and are easily processible to remove the transmuted material. The United States does not currently have an active facility for the permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel derived from the civilian nuclear sector. Used nuclear fuel comprises several classes of isotopes that could be processed in different ways due to their economic value. Firstly, uranium (U), which comprises greater than 95% of the mass of UNF, can be reprocessed and converted back into fuel for light-water reactors through the addition of small amounts of uranium-235 (U-235). Secondly, plutonium (Pu) and minor actinides (MAs), such as neptunium (Np), americium (Am), and curium (Cm), which together comprise roughly 1.5% of UNF by mass, are produced from nuclear fission. Many of these isotopes are fissionable and could be incorporated into fuels designed for advanced reactor concepts. Intermediate-lived fission products (ILFPs) including strontium-90 (Sr-90) and caesium-137 (Cs-137) have relatively short half-lives of roughly 30 years and have applications in radioisotope thermoelectric generators for space applications. However, ILFPs are largely destined for permanent disposal in a deep geological repository. The major long-lived fission products (LLFPs) have half-lives exceeding 200,000 years and have few commercial applications. LLFPS include selenium-79 (Se-79),technetium-99 (Tc-99), tin-126 (Sn-126), iodine-129 (I-129), and caesium-135 (Cs-135). The last class of isotopes are the stable isotopes produced from nuclear fission and resulting decay. These isotopes could be extracted from UNF, but no commercial processing of these have been undertaken. A deep geological disposal facility for the disposition of UNF in the U.S. has been estimated to cost $96.18 billion over the 150-year lifetime, after which the facility would cease to accept new waste. This facility would be able to store 70,000 metric tons (MT) of unprocessed UNF, which is insufficient for the existing volume of civilian waste. Densification of the waste can be accomplished through removal of the plutonium, minor actinides, and ILFP components of the UNF. Removal of 99.9% of these components would allow a densification factor of 225, based on current disposal requirements, thus allowing a single repository to store upwards of approximately 16 million MT of UNF. The LLFPs are responsible for many of the engineered barriers that are required to be built in the repository due to their long half-lives and environmental mobility. Removal of these LLFPs could decrease the capital expenditure of a permanent geological repository while also improving safety.

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): “(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that— (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.” ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. § 16538. The FOA and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.” Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”) should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). Program Overview: The energy transition towards net-zero by 2050 demands an unprecedented level of innovation that must be completed in the span of a generation. Global primary energy usage has increased continuously for the past century. This increase is expected to continue with improved standards of living and the rapid expansion of new technologies with high levels of energy-intensive computation, such as artificial intelligence. Present grid capacity is constrained and cannot accommodate these increasing primary energy needs to reliably deliver power on demand. Meanwhile, all paths through the energy transition require concurrent efforts to decouple the production of essential carbon-based materials from harmful greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Since the Agency’s inception, the ARPA-E OPEN program has served as an opportunity to advance transformative energy breakthroughs in critical areas that fall outside the scope of its technology-focused programs. Vision OPEN challenges the research community to develop groundbreaking technologies to enable a future energy landscape that is dramatically different. The Vision includes three goals that are critical to achieve a sustainable energy and carbon transition with: 1) GHG-free abundant primary energy; 2) An intermodal energy superhighway that transports diversified forms of primary energy; and 3) A carbon transition that sustainably meets demand for polymers and other materials.

Research addressing all types of arthritis is encouraged including but not limited to osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, juvenile arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The ATRP encourages applications that address sex as a biological variable and understudied arthritis types. The ATRP also encourages applicants to consider whether large data sets or existing studies/consortia can be leveraged to maximize the potential impact of proposed studies.\nApplicants must address how the proposed research may eventually impact patient care and reduce the burden of disease. It is expected that any research findings would benefit Service Members, their Families, Veterans, and the general public. To meet the intent of the award mechanism, applications must specifically address at least one FY24 ATRP FRA focus area, listed in Section II.A.1, above.\nImportant aspects of this award mechanism include:\nImpact: A key aspect of this award mechanism is impact. The application should explicitly state how outcomes of the proposed research will have a significant impact on the advancement of arthritis research, potential for exploration of novel ideas, and/or patient care practices. The application should clearly indicate how the research addresses the impact of arthritis in the military, which may include its effect on Service Member recruitment, retention, and recovery. Applicants may also choose to include impacts to the Military Health System, which provides health care support to Service Members and their Families (Eligibility | TRICARE).\nResearch Levels: The FY24 ATRP FRA offers funding for two Research Levels (refer to Section II.D.5 Funding Restrictions). Only one Research Level category may be chosen per application. It is the responsibility of the applicant to select the level that aligns with the scope of the proposed research. The Research Level should be selected based on the research scope and not on the amount of the budget. The following are generalized descriptions of the scope of the research appropriate for each level:\n• Research Level 1: Supports exploratory, high-risk/high-reward research that is in the early stages of idea development. Research must have the potential to yield new avenues of investigation, such as new approaches, new research tools, or new paradigms. Early career investigators are particularly encouraged to apply to this research level.\n• Research Level 2: Supports the advancement of preclinical research toward clinical translation.\nPreliminary data are required: Applications must include preliminary and/or published data to support the proposed research project. The included data may originate from other researchers or research conducted by the applicant(s). Applicants must demonstrate logical reasoning for the proposed work. To be competitive, the application must include a sound scientific rationale and a well-formulated, testable hypothesis established through a critical review and analysis of the literature.\nAdvancing Women’s Health Research and Innovation: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health. The ATRP therefore encourages research that addresses how arthritis and arthritis care may affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men.\nRigor of Experimental Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies.\nThe FY24 ATRP FRA mechanism is intended to support preclinical or animal research and may not be used for clinical research or clinical trials. Applicants seeking funding for a clinical trial or clinical research should consider the FY24 ATRP Clinical Research Award mechanism (Funding Opportunity Number: HT9425FY24ATRPCRA).\nA clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials.\nFor the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes:\n(1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or coinvestigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies.\n(2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention.\n(3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial.\nExcluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule.\nThe funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304).\nThe anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 ATRP FRA should not exceed $500,000 (Research Level 1) or $750,000 (Research Level 2). Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information.\nAwards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025.\nThe CDMRP expects to allot approximately $2.5M to fund approximately two FRA – Research Level 1 applications and two FRA – Research Level 2 applications. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030."", 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nCDMRP Help Desk\nPhone: 301-682-5507\nEmail: help@eBRAP.org\n\nCDMRP Help Desk'}"

The research project should include a well-formulated, testable hypothesis based on strong scientific rationale and a well-developed and articulated research approach. Personnel on the proposed team should have a strong background in kidney cancer research.\nThe following are significant features of this award mechanism:\nResearch Approach: The scientific rationale and experimental methodology should demonstrate critical understanding and in-depth analysis of kidney cancer. Experimental strategies may be novel or may be based on strong rationale derived from previously published data and/or presented preliminary data. The feasibility of the research design and methods should be well-defined, and a clear plan should be articulated as to how the proposed goals of the project can be achieved. Additionally, resources should be identified, and availability supported through documentation. Identification of potential problems and pitfalls with alternate approaches should be addressed. A statistical analysis plan for the proposed research should be included, if applicable, as well as a power analysis to support the design and sample size.\nPreliminary Data: Preliminary data are required but need not be in kidney cancer. Preliminary data may include unpublished or published results from the laboratory of the Principal Investigator (PI) or collaborators named on the application and/or data from the published literature relevant to kidney cancer.\nInnovation: Innovative research may introduce a new paradigm, challenge existing paradigms, look at existing problems from new perspectives, or exhibit other creative qualities. This may include high-risk, potentially high-gain, approaches to kidney cancer research, provided the application demonstrates the potential for significant impact on the field of research, patient care, and/or quality of life. Research that is likely to yield only an incremental advance is not considered innovative.\nImpact: Proposed research projects should address a central critical issue or question in kidney cancer research or clinical care. High-impact research will, if successful, significantly advance current methods and concepts in at least one of the FY24 KCRP Focus Areas.\nPersonnel: Personnel are considered a crucial element of the FY24 KCRP Idea Development Award. The application should demonstrate the investigators’ experience in kidney cancer through the PI’s background, the research team, and/or through collaboration. Collaborations should be documented.\nThe following are general descriptions, although not all-inclusive, of the scope of research projects that would be appropriate to propose under the current program announcement:\n• All Applications: Innovative, high-risk/high-reward and/or preclinical research that is supported by preliminary and/or published data.\nPartnering PI Option: The FY24 KCRP supports collaborative research to bring a new perspective to kidney cancer research and/or facilitate progress in the field by combined efforts. Therefore, the KCRP Idea Development Award mechanism includes a Partnering PI Option, which is structured so that two investigators, each of whom will be designated as a PI and receive a separate award, will work synergistically on a single project. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI will be identified as a Partnering PI. Both PIs should collaborate to develop a synergistic project addressing one or more of the FY24 KCRP Idea Development Award Focus Areas. Applications submitted by a mentor and trainee as Initiating PI and Partnering PI do not meet the intent of the Partnering PI Option. Multidisciplinary and multi-organizational projects are allowed. Initiating and Partnering PIs each have different submission requirements, as described in Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission; however, both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project, including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. It should be clear that both investigators have had an equal level of intellectual input and effort in developing the application. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization.\nApplications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and the American public. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research.\nResearch involving human subjects and human anatomical substances is permitted; however, clinical trials are not allowed under this funding opportunity.\nA clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials.\nFor the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes:\n(1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies.\n(2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention.\n(3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial.\nExcluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule.\nOrganizational-Level Emphasis:\nThe following areas of emphasis are broadly applicable to many CDMRP programs, not just the KCRP. Investigators are encouraged to consider addressing these areas in their applications if doing so is appropriate for their line of research and addresses the FY24 KCRP strategic goals and focus areas described in Section II.A.1 and Section II.A.2.\nNuclear Medicine: Innovative research involving nuclear medicine and related techniques to support early diagnosis, more effective treatment, and improved health outcomes of active-duty Service Members and their Families is encouraged. Such research could improve diagnostic and targeted treatment capabilities through noninvasive techniques and may drive the development of precision imaging and advanced targeted therapies.\nWomen’s Health: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women's health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health.\nMetastatic Cancer Task Force: A congressionally mandated Metastatic Cancer Task Force was formed with the purpose of identifying ways to help accelerate clinical and translational research aimed at extending the lives of advanced state and recurrent patients. As a member of the Metastatic Cancer Task Force, the CDMRP encourages applicants to review the recommendations (https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Congressional-Testimonies/2018/ 05/03/Metastatic-Cancer-Research) and submit research ideas to address these recommendations provided they are within the limitations of this funding opportunity and fit within the FY24 KCRP priorities.\nRigorous Study Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies.\nMilitary Service Involvement: Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and the American public. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research.\nThe funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304).\nThe anticipated direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 KCRP IDA should not exceed $800,000. The anticipated combined direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 KCRP Idea Development Award – Partnering PI Option will not exceed $1.2M. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information.\nAwards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025.\nThe CDMRP expects to allot approximately $18.56M to fund approximately 13 Idea Development Award applications.

Though the RTRP Investigator-Initiated Research Award mechanism supports groundbreaking research, all projects must demonstrate solid scientific rationale with military-relevant utility. Important aspects of this award mechanism include:\n• Study Design and Feasibility: The proposed study design should be clearly described, rigorous, and support maximal reproducibility and translational feasibility. A statistical plan with appropriate power analysis should be included, as applicable. If a model system is included in the research, it should be appropriate for the study and applicable to VCA.\n• Impact: The short- and long-term impact of the proposed research should be clearly articulated. Projects must address at least one of the FY24 RTRP Investigator-Initiated Research Award Focus Areas.\n• Military Relevance: All projects must be responsive to the health care needs of military Service Members and/or Veterans recovering from traumatic injury, and/or their Family members, caregivers, or clinicians, as well as the general public. Collaboration with military researchers and clinicians is encouraged, but not required.\n• Preliminary Data: Observations that drive a research idea may be derived from laboratory discovery, population-based studies, a clinician’s first-hand knowledge of patients, or anecdotal data. Preliminary and/or published data that are relevant to reconstructive transplantation and support the rationale for the proposed research must be included.\nImportant Note: Leveraging novel findings from solid organ transplant research for testing in a VCA setting is acceptable if the rationale and benefits for doing so are appropriately explained and justified. For example, it should be clear why the anticipated result might be different in VCA, or why it’s important to confirm the result is the same in VCA, or why repeating the study in a VCA setting could lead to new mechanistic insights or a better understanding of unique aspects of VCA.\nInvestigator-Initiated Research Award applications may focus on any phase of research from basic through translational, including preclinical studies in animal models, and clinical research in human subjects or human anatomical substances, as well as correlative studies associated with an existing clinical trial.\nAdvancing Women’s Health Research and Innovation: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health. The RTRP therefore encourages research that addresses how various aspects of reconstructive transplant affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men.\nMultiple Principal Investigator (PI) Option: The Investigator-Initiated Research Award includes an option for up to four PIs. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI(s) will be identified as Partnering PI(s). All PIs should contribute significantly to the development and execution of the proposed research project. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI(s), refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission.\nRigor of Experimental Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html).

This award supports the development of translational research collaborations between two independent, faculty-level (or equivalent) investigators to address a central problem or question in kidney cancer in a manner that would be less readily achievable through separate efforts. One partner in the collaboration must be a research scientist and the other must be a clinician. It should be clear that both have had equal intellectual input in the design of the research project. Multi-institutional partnerships are encouraged. At least one member of the partnership must have experience either in kidney cancer research or kidney cancer patient care. Inclusion of experts from outside the kidney cancer field is encouraged. A proposed project in which the clinical partner merely supplies tissue samples or access to patients will not meet the intent of this award mechanism.\nPreliminary data to support the feasibility of the research hypothesis and research approaches are required; however, these data do not necessarily need to be derived from studies of kidney cancer.\nObservations that drive a research idea may be derived from a laboratory discovery, population-based studies, or a clinician’s firsthand knowledge of patients and anecdotal data. The ultimate goal of translational research is to move a concept or observation forward into clinical application that is relevant to active-duty Service Members, Veterans, and/or the American public. However, members of the partnership should not view translational research as a one-way continuum from bench to bedside. The research plan must involve a reciprocal flow of ideas and information between basic and clinical science (bench to bedside and/or bedside to bench). There should be an intellectual synergistic partnership between the clinic and the laboratory.\nThe success of the project must be supported by the unique skills and contributions of each partner. The proposed study must include clearly stated plans for interactions between the Principal Investigators (PIs) and institutions involved. The plans must include communication, coordination of research progress and results, and data transfer. Additionally, multi-institutional applications must provide an intellectual property plan to resolve potential intellectual and material property issues and to remove institutional barriers that might interfere with achieving high levels of cooperation to ensure the successful completion of this award.\nThe following are significant features of this award mechanism:\nThe Translational Research Partnership Award (TRPA) requires two or more PIs. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI(s) will be identified as Partnering PI(s). All PIs should contribute significantly to the development and execution of the proposed research project. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Initiating PI and Partnering PI, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission.\n• Partnership: The success of the project should depend on the unique skills and contributions of each partner.\n• Translation: The application should provide evidence for the reciprocal transfer of information between basic and clinical science, or vice-versa, in developing and implementing the research plan. Translational research may include correlative studies and/or development of or use of annotated biorepositories. The application should demonstrate how the study will leverage clinical information to address knowledge gaps in resulting outcomes, validate key research findings, expand upon potentially transformative results, and/or investigate novel findings.\n• Impact: The proposed research should indicate the potential to have a significant impact on kidney cancer research and/or patient care and have the potential to accelerate the movement of promising ideas (in prevention, diagnosis, detection, prognosis, treatment, and/or survivorship) into clinical applications. Clinical trials are not allowed.\n• Feasibility: The application should demonstrate that the investigators have access to the necessary specimens, data, and/or intervention, as applicable.\n• Preliminary Data: Unpublished results from the laboratory of the Principal Investigators (PIs) named on the application and/or data from the published literature that are relevant to kidney cancer and the proposed research project are required.\nProjects including Correlative Studies: The FY24 KCRP Translational Research Partnership Award may support correlative studies that are associated with an ongoing or completed clinical trial. The application should demonstrate access to the necessary specimens and/or data of the proposed cohort. Appropriate access must be confirmed at the time of application submission. See Attachment 11, Letter(s) Confirming Access to Specimens and/or Data.\nOrganizational-Level Emphasis Areas: The following areas of emphasis are broadly applicable to many CDMRP programs, not just the KCRP. Investigators are encouraged to consider addressing these areas in their applications if doing so is appropriate for their line of research, addresses the FY24 KCRP Overarching Strategic Goals and Focus Areas described in Section II.A., and meets the intent of the Translational Research Partnership Award.\nNuclear Medicine: Innovative research involving nuclear medicine and related techniques to support early diagnosis, more effective treatment, and improved health outcomes of active-duty Service Members and their Families is encouraged. Such research could improve diagnostic and targeted treatment capabilities through noninvasive techniques and may drive the development of precision imaging and advanced targeted therapies.\nWomen’s Health: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women’s health.\nMetastatic Cancer Task Force: A congressionally mandated Metastatic Cancer Task Force was formed with the purpose of identifying ways to help accelerate clinical and translational research aimed at extending the lives of advanced state and recurrent patients. As a member of the Metastatic Cancer Task Force, The CDMRP encourages applicants to review the recommendations (https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Congressional-Testimonies/2018/05/03/Metastatic-Cancer-Research) and submit research ideas to address these recommendations provided they are within the limitations of this funding opportunity and fit within the FY24 KCRP priorities.\nRigorous Study Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research.

The program competition's approximate total award funding per year is $1,500,000.00.\nRecent societal impacts from hurricanes, floods, snow storms, tornadoes, and wildfires demonstrates that, although there have been considerable advances in weather prediction and forecasting, there is a continual need to understand the intersection of human behavior and meteorology. A variety of social, behavioral, and environmental factors “affect how we prepare for, observe, predict, respond to, and are impacted by weather hazards” (NASEM, 2018. doi:10.17226/24865). Thus, social, behavioral, and economic science (SBES) research plays a critical role in connecting NOAA's weather forecast information and improvements to the public’s growing forecast needs.\nThe Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 further recognizes the importance of SBES science integration within the larger weather enterprise by emphasizing the need to improve our understanding of how people (e.g., NWS stakeholders, forecasters, the public) receive, interpret, and respond to warnings and forecasts of weather events that endanger life and property, as well as how to best communicate weather events to various stakeholders. Additionally, the NOAA Science Advisory Board published a report titled Priorities in Weather Research with a recommendation to “Increase investments in social and human behavioral data collection and sciences to better understand how weather products are used and to support co-development of improved products” (p.6 https://sab.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PWR-Report_Final_12-9-21.pdf).\nFor the purposes of NOAA-funded projects, the maturity of projects is broadly classified using Readiness Levels (RLs), as adopted by NOAA and other federal agencies. The numerical RL scale from 1 to 9 is designed to track project maturity across a progressive spectrum from research to development to demonstration to deployment. Projects appropriate for this competition range from Readiness Level (RL) 2 to RL 8 and have potential to transition to operations at either NOAA or the weather and water enterprise within the next 3 to 7 years. Additional information can be found in the Program Objectives (Section I.A) and Priorities (Section I.B), and definitions of RLs can be found in the WPO FY25 General Information Sheet (herein referred to as the “General Information Sheet”) accompanying this announcement.\nNOAA, OAR, and WPO encourage applicants and awardees to write their proposals and perform their work in a manner consistent with NOAA’s core values, including those on diversity, inclusion, accessibility, civil rights, and scientific integrity.

The KCRP AKCIECSA is not a traditional career development award; the ECS is expected to conduct research, participate in monthly webinars, and annual workshops, and communicate and collaborate with other members of the Academy (other Early-Career Scholars, mentors, Academy Leadership Team) as well as with the kidney cancer advocacy community.\nThe KCRP Academy of Kidney Cancer Investigators – Early-Career Scholar Award supports a unique, interactive virtual academy providing intensive mentoring, national networking, collaborations, and a peer group for junior faculty emerging as potential leaders of kidney cancer research. The overarching goal of the AKCI is to advance kidney cancer research through development of highly productive kidney cancer researchers in a collaborative research and career development environment.\nThe Academy Leadership Team, consisting of Academy Director and Deputy Director, serves as a resource for the ECS and mentors, assessing the progress of the ECS and facilitating communication and collaboration among all of the Early-Career Scholars and Designated Mentors, as well as with research and advocacy communities. In addition to fostering ECS scientific development, the AKCI, through its leadership by the Academy Leadership Team, provides professional and leadership development of the ECS to include skills and competencies needed to fund and manage a productive laboratory or research team.\nThis FY24 program announcement is soliciting Early-Career Scholars and Designated Mentors to join the existing Academy of Kidney Cancer Investigators. This award mechanism enables the ECS (the Scholar named as the Principal Investigator [PI] on the application) to pursue a kidney cancer project that may be basic, translational, and/or clinical research. The Designated Mentor is not required to be at the same institution as the ECS.\nThe KCRP encourages applications from Early-Career Scholars whose ability to commit to conducting kidney cancer research is limited by minimal resources or a lack of resources, such as a qualified Designated Mentor at their institution, access to kidney cancer research tools, opportunities for establishing collaborations, or other obstacles, which should be identified in the application.\nPreliminary data to support the feasibility of the research applications and approaches are required; however, this data does not necessarily need to be derived from the kidney cancer research field.\nThe ECS must be in the early-career stage. This award provides the ECS with funding, networking and collaborative opportunities, and research experience necessary to develop and sustain a successful, independent career at the forefront of kidney cancer research. This award also provides support and protected time for the ECS for 4 years of intensive research under the guidance of a Designated Mentor experienced in kidney cancer research. Although the AKCI will serve as a conduit to share knowledge and research experience among all Academy members, the ECS and Designated Mentor will be responsible for developing the career development plans of the ECS and for designing and executing the proposed research. The ECS must clearly articulate their commitment to a career as a kidney cancer researcher and to participating in and contributing to the growth of the AKCI.\nThe Designated Mentor must have a strong record of mentoring and training early-career investigators. With the goal to expand and enrich mentorship capacity within the Academy, a Designated Mentor must agree to also serve as a Secondary Mentor to another ECS in the Academy. The Designated Mentor will be limited to one Primary (applicant ECS/mentor pair) and one Secondary Mentorship. Applicants are not permitted to list the Dean of the Academy as a Designated Mentor. The ECS and Designated Mentor are required to attend a biennial multi-day Department of Defense (DOD) KCRP AKCI Workshop and, in alternate years, a 1-day DOD KCRP AKCI Workshop.\nOrganizational-Level Emphasis: The following areas of emphasis are broadly applicable to many CDMRP programs, not just the KCRP. Investigators are encouraged to consider addressing these areas in their applications if doing so is appropriate for their line of research, addresses the FY24 KCRP Overarching Strategic Goals and Focus Areas described in Sections II.A.1 and II.A.2, and meets the intent of the AKCIECSA.\nNuclear Medicine: Innovative research involving nuclear medicine and related techniques to support early diagnosis, more effective treatment, and improved health outcomes of active-duty Service Members and their Families is encouraged. Such research could improve diagnostic and targeted treatment capabilities through noninvasive techniques and may drive the development of precision imaging and advanced targeted therapies.\nWomen’s Health: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women’s health.\nMetastatic Cancer Task Force: A congressionally mandated Metastatic Cancer Task Force was formed with the purpose of identifying ways to help accelerate clinical and translational research aimed at extending the lives of advanced state and recurrent patients. As a member of the Metastatic Cancer Task Force, the CDMRP encourages applicants to review the recommendations (https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Congressional-Testimonies/2018/05/03/ Metastatic-Cancer-Research) and submit research ideas to address these recommendations provided they are within the limitations of this funding opportunity and fit within the FY24 KCRP priorities.\nRigorous Study Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies.\nMilitary Service Involvement: Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and/or the American public. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research.\nResearch involving human subjects and human anatomical substances is permitted; however, clinical trials are not allowed under this funding opportunity.\nA clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials.\nFor the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes:\n(1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention.

To be competitive, the application must include a sound scientific rationale and a well-formulated, testable hypothesis established through a critical review and analysis of the literature.\nAdvancing Women’s Health Research and Innovation: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health. The ATRP therefore encourages research that addresses how arthritis and arthritis care may affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men.\nRigor of Experimental Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. The FY24 ATRP CRA mechanism is intended to support clinical research or clinical trials and may not be used for preclinical or animal research. Applicants seeking funding for preclinical research or animal research should consider the FY24 ATRP Focused Research Award mechanism (Funding Opportunity Number: HT9425FY24ATRFRA).\nA clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials.\nFor the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes:\n(1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or coinvestigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies.\n(2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention.\n(3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial.\nExcluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule.\nThe funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304).\nThe anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 ATRP CRA should not exceed $1.5M or $3.0M (Clinical Trial Option). Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information.\nAwards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025.\nThe CDMRP expects to allot approximately $6.0M to fund approximately two Clinical Research Award applications and one Clinical Research Award – Clinical Trial Option application. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds.

These resources may benefit individuals throughout the VCA community, including those who are considering or who have already received reconstructive transplant surgery, as well as caregivers, potential donors and their families, and clinicians. The RTRP recognizes that these resources are not yet deployable products and require further research to ready them for clinical and community use. Proposed studies should expand previously funded qualitative research for the purposes of validating a VCA resource and/or investigating the most appropriate and effective methods and best practices for disseminating and/or implementing the resource. Important Note: This award mechanism is intended to support validation and implementation research, but not the costs of implementation itself.\nQualitative research is a form of social inquiry that focuses on understanding how people interpret and make sense of their experiences and the world in which they live. Observations that drive a research idea may be derived from basic discovery, population-based studies, a clinician’s first-hand knowledge of patients, or anecdotal data. Qualitative research is intended to be exploratory, open-ended, and unbiased. The information gathered should be meaningful and culturally appropriate to the participant, unanticipated (not hypothesis-based) by the research team, and rich and explanatory in nature.\nImplementation science is defined as the scientific study of methods and strategies to adopt and integrate evidence-based health interventions, resources, etc., into clinical and community settings in order to improve patient outcomes and benefit population health. Implementation research may use a variety of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine the most appropriate and effective way to transition interventions, resources, etc., into clinical practice, health policy, or everyday use. The research should be specific to the target population and environment and consider real-world factors and complexities, including an evolving landscape.\nImportant aspects of this award mechanism include:\n• Qualitative Approach: The research approach should include primarily qualitative methods. Qualitative findings may lead the research in a more quantifiable direction, in which case a mixed methods approach is acceptable. The specific theoretical basis (e.g., interactionism, phenomenology, critical theory) for the study should be stated and should drive the framing of the research problem.\n• Preliminary data (required): Applications must include an Outcomes Statement (Attachment 9), which is a summary of the research previously funded, and a description of the research accomplishments, outcomes, and resource(s) developed from that award. Applications should provide an explanation of how these accomplishments, outcomes, and resource(s) provide the basis for the proposed research and how expansion of the original research ideas will address one or both of the FY24 RTRP Qualitative Research Focus Areas.\n• Study Design: The proposed study design, sampling technique, data collection, and recording method(s) should be appropriate to yield trustworthy, credible, robust, and confirmable results. The documentation of procedures, decisions, and rationale for decisions and conclusions should support consistency, dependability, and duplicability of results and prevent biases and preconceptions. The data analysis plan should be consistent with the research problem and theoretical basis for the study, and ongoing feedback from participants should be incorporated throughout the project, especially regarding interpretation of data and study conclusions. It should be clear how the proposed study design will position the resource(s) for the next phase of development or implementation as described in the post-award Implementation Plan (Attachment 10).\n• Impact: The short- and long-term impact of the proposed research should be clearly articulated. Projects must address one or both of the FY24 RTRP Qualitative Research Focus Areas.\n• Military Relevance: All projects must be responsive to the health care needs of military Service Members and/or Veterans recovering from traumatic injury, and/or their Family members, caregivers or clinicians, as well as the general public. Collaboration with military researchers and clinicians is encouraged, but not required.\nAdvancing Women’s Health Research and Innovation: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women’s health. The RTRP therefore encourages research that addresses how various aspects of reconstructive transplant affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men.\nUse of Department of Defense (DOD) or VA Resources: Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, VA, and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and/or their Families. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research.\nClinical trials are not allowed under this funding opportunity. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials.\nClinical research is allowed under this funding opportunity.

The outcome of research supported by this award should be the generation of robust data that can be used as a foundation for new avenues of scientific investigation.\nImportant aspects of this award mechanism include:\n• Innovation: The proposed project should be novel and innovative. Innovative research may introduce a new paradigm, challenge existing paradigms, look at existing problems from new perspectives, or exhibit other uniquely creative qualities. If the proposed project is building upon established research performed in solid tissue organs, there must be justification for how the proposed theory is novel. Research that is an incremental advance upon published data or a logical progression of an already established research project is not considered innovative and will not be considered for funding under this award mechanism.\nImportant Note: Leveraging novel findings from solid organ transplant research for testing in a VCA setting is acceptable if the rationale and benefits for doing so are appropriately explained and justified. For example, it should be clear why the anticipated result might be different in VCA, or why it’s important to confirm the result is the same in VCA, or why repeating the study in a VCA setting could lead to new mechanistic insights or a better understanding of unique aspects of VCA.\n• Hypothesis and Rationale: The proposed research project should include a well-formulated testable hypothesis based on strong scientific rationale and study design. If a model system is included in the research, it should be appropriate for the study and applicable to VCA.\n• Preliminary Data: Inclusion of preliminary and/or published data that support the scientific rationale or evidence that the proposed work can be completed are required; however, the proposed work should be innovative and untested.\n• Impact: Applications must address at least one of the FY24 RTRP IDA Focus Areas.

Recipients will be required to upload study data annually and in accordance with the FITBIR data submission policies. There is no fee to use FITBIR, and detailed guidance and policies, including a cost estimator tool for budgeting considerations, can be found at\nhttps://fitbir.nih.gov.\no While there is no direct charge to users of the FITBIR Informatics System, a project estimation tool is available to help estimate costs and manpower needs that may be associated with data submission.\nWomen’s Health: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women's health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health.\nFunding from this award mechanism must support a clinical trial and may not be used for animal or preclinical studies. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials.\nFor more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document_DEC2022.pdf.\nKey aspects of the DMRDP PTRCTA Mechanism:\n• Applicability to Section 723 of the FY24 NDAA: The application must propose to address at least one of the two covered conditions (PTSD and/or TBI) and evaluate at least one of the covered psychedelic substances listed in Section II.B.\n• Clinical Trial Start Date: The proposed clinical trial is expected to begin no later than 6 months after the award date.\n• Preliminary Data Are Required: Inclusion of preliminary data relevant to the proposed clinical trial is required.\n• Study Population: Inclusion of active-duty Service Members, which may include members of the reserve components, is required. Study populations other than Service Members will not be supported. While Veterans are an important population, they are not the focus of this funding opportunity. The outcomes of the study are expected to benefit Service Members, Veterans, and the general public. The application should demonstrate the availability of and access to a suitable population of U.S. Service Members that will support a meaningful outcome for the study. The application should include a discussion of how accrual goals will be achieved, as well as the strategy for inclusion of women and minorities in the clinical trial appropriate to the objectives of the study. • Intervention Availability: The application should demonstrate the documented availability of and access to the proposed psychedelic substance and other materials needed, as appropriate, for the proposed duration of the study.\n• Personnel and Environment: The application should demonstrate the study team’s expertise and experience in all aspects of conducting clinical trials and working with controlled substances, including appropriate statistical analysis, knowledge of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) processes (if applicable), enrolling military populations, and data management. The application should include a study coordinator(s) who will guide the clinical protocol through the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) of record and other federal agency regulatory approval processes, coordinate activities from all sites participating in the trial, and coordinate participant accrual. The application should show strong institutional support and, if applicable, a commitment to serve as the FDA regulatory sponsor, ensuring all sponsor responsibilities described in 21 CFR 312, Subpart D, are fulfilled.\n• Statistical Analysis and Data Management Plans: The application should include a clearly articulated statistical analysis plan, a power analysis reflecting sample size projections that will answer the objectives of the study, and a data management plan that includes use of an appropriate database to safeguard and maintain the integrity of the data.

To be eligible to apply or receive an award, applicant organizations must complete and maintain three system registrations and access to include: SAM.gov, Grants.gov, and eRA Commons. For each, the complete registration process can take 4 to 6 weeks, so applicants must begin this activity as soon as possible and well before the proposal due date. For more information on how to meet these registration and application submission requirements without errors, we advise all to carefully review relevant eRA Applicant and Grantee Training modules: https://www.commerce.gov/ocio/programs/gems/applicant-and-grantee-training. Additionally, we advise that all applicants carefully read “Additional Application Package Forms” within the “Full Proposal Required Elements” section below. No foreign applicants based outside of the U.S. may request funding. Applicability to Federal Employees and Federal Contractors: Federal employees (hereafter referred to as “federal collaborator(s)”) may serve as co-Principal Investigators (co-PIs) or co-Investigators (co-Is) but their salary costs are ineligible expenses to be covered by awards from this NOFO. NOAA Federal applicants are required to partner with one or more eligible non-federal institution(s) who would submit the application for the competition through Grants.gov per instructions in Section IV.K “Other Submission Requirements.” Eligibility also depends on the statutory authority that permits NOAA to fund the proposed activity. For the purposes of this funding announcement, prospective PIs that are also employed as federal contractors have the same eligibility restrictions as Federal employees. Costs incurred by NOAA federal collaborators are eligible for funding through this NOFO only if they fit into one of the categories listed below. Further details are provided in the attached General Information Sheet. Allowed: NOAA federal collaborator travel is only eligible in critical project-dependent cases. Other allowable expenses include project-critical equipment, indirect costs for NOAA affiliate institutions, infrastructure, and testbed-related costs. NOT Allowed: Conference and workshop travel. Any other direct funding for federal institutions, including employee salaries or other costs not listed as eligible in Section III.A, will not be considered as part of this funding opportunity. All funded investigators must assure and verify, if requested, that they will not be allocated for greater than 100% of their annual employment time should their proposal be selected for funding. NOAA will verify this requirement if the proposal is recommended for funding.'}","{'Agency Name:': 'DOC NOAA - ERA Production', 'Description:': ""NOAA’s Weather Program Office (WPO, wpo.noaa.gov/nofo) is soliciting proposals for the Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) grant competition from this notification. The program’s competition approximate total award funding per year is $1,500,000.00.\nIn alignment with the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-25), this funding opportunity will allow NOAA to support new weather, water, and earth system observing and forecasting applications, including improved analysis techniques, better statistical or dynamic forecast models and techniques, development of calibrated, probabilistic forecasts, and communication of that information to better inform the public. In particular, this NOFO will seek projects that are responsive to the priorities articulated in the Science Advisory Board's 2021 Priorities for Weather Research Report (https://sab.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PWR-Report_Final_12-9-21.pdf) as well as the National Weather Service’s strategic priority to advance probabilistic forecasting and decision support services (https://www.weather.gov/media/wrn/NWS-2023-Strategic-Plan.pdf).\nFor the purposes of NOAA-funded projects, the maturity of projects is broadly classified using Readiness Levels (RLs), as adopted by NOAA and other federal agencies. The numerical RL scale from 1 to 9 is designed to track project maturity across a progressive spectrum from research to development to demonstration to deployment. Some science priorities in this announcement may target research at a specific maturity level and restrict proposals to specific RL ranges. Additional information can be found in the Program Objectives (Section I.A) and Priorities (Section I.B), and definitions of RLs can be found in the WPO FY25 General Information Sheet (herein referred to as the “General Information Sheet”) accompanying this announcement.\nNOAA, OAR, and WPO encourage applicants and awardees to write their proposals and perform their work in a manner consistent with NOAA’s core values, including those on diversity, inclusion, accessibility, civil rights, and scientific integrity. Promoting diversity and inclusion improves creativity, productivity, and the vitality of the weather and water research community in which WPO engages. Further information can be found at https://www.noaa.gov/organization/inclusion-and-civil-rights/diversity-and-inclusion and https://research.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FinalDraft-OAR-DEI-StrategicPlan-07Sep2021.docx.pdf.\nIncluded under the ‘Related Documents’ tab of this announcement are several Information Sheets as well as external forms required to be submitted with proposals. If there is any conflicting information between the NOFO announcement and the attached Information Sheets, then the NOFO announcement takes priority and should be followed over any external attachments."", 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nAll questions regarding this announcement should be sent to oar.wpo.nofocompetition@noaa.gov with the specific name of the competition and program manager, as chronicled below, placed in the subject line to route the inquiry to the appropriate program.\n\nSubseasonal to Seasonal (S2S): Mark Olsen\n\nBusiness'}"

TWSC aligns to the 2022 Plan’s Goal Statement: “NASA’s enduring purpose is scientific discovery and exploration for the benefit of the United States and all of humanity. NASA seeks to discover the secrets of the universe, search for life elsewhere, and protect and improve life on Earth and in space. Finding answers to these profound science questions requires support for national priorities in science and exploration, enhancing new opportunities for cross-disciplinary science, and expanding the societal benefits of our science programs.” TWSC award sizes will vary from amounts in the low thousands of dollars—for example to cover travel and registration to a third-party’s event — to $750,000 or more for a large event.\n\nTWSC welcomes proposals for large and small meetings, retreats, seminars, symposiums, workshops, or other events, including asynchronous and virtual workshops, etc. The purpose of TWSC events may be 1) to disseminate technical information beyond NASA and SMD; or 2) to facilitate research networks and/or research administration capabilities at entities not previously funded by NASA. Participation is open to U.S. organizations or institutions, including minority serving educational and not-for-profit institutions, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), NASA Centers, and other Government agencies. See the NOFO’s Section 3, for detailed eligibility information.\n\nTWSC has no dedicated funding, so proposers are directed to first contact a NASA division, office, or program that may have funding before preparing a proposal. For more details about how to identify and contact possible funders in SMD see Section 7.1. TWSC does not accept Notices of Intent (NOI). Instead, potential proposers must prepare an “Inquiry Email” as described in the NOFO’s Section 4.2.1, and receive an email response from an SMD Program Officer(s), TWSC point of contact, or Division Director prior to submitting a full proposal.\n\nTWSC primarily awards grants made under the authority of 2 CFR 200. When NASA and other federal civil servants or employees of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) propose to TWSC, the event that they proposed may be subject to limitations described in Sections 4.14, ""Within NASA, Inter-Agency and NASA-as Primary Sponsor Awards"", and 2.6.1, “Non-Assistance Proposals and Awards and Assistance Awards that Propose Work or Activities by NASA or JPL or Other Federal Entities”. TWSC is authorized by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, P.L. 111-314 and National Space Program 42 U.S.C. §§ 2451-2484 (1976) P.L. 85-568.\n\nAll interested parties must read the NOFO carefully. All proposals to TWSC must comply with the requirements, constraints, and guidelines contained within the NOFO. Any costs incurred in preparing submissions in response to this email or to the full NOFO are incurred completely at the submitter\'s own risk. To find TWSC’s full text, visit the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) at https://nspires.nasaprs.com/ and select “Solicitations” at the top of the page, and on the next page in the search box, input the number “NNH24ZDA002N” or use the short URL listed above.

Growing the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce is a national priority. National forecasts of the impending shortage of workers with science and engineering skills and essential research workers underscore a need to expand opportunities to participate in STEM research (President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2012). MSIs make considerable contributions to educating and training science leaders for U.S. economic growth and competitiveness. Yet NSF has received comparatively few grant submissions from, or involving, scholars at MSIs. Targeted outreach activities reveal that MSIs have varying degrees of familiarity with funding opportunities within NSF and particularly within the Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) Sciences Directorate. As a result, NSF is limited in its ability to support research and training opportunities in the SBE sciences at these institutions. With its emphasis on broadening participation , Build and Broaden is designed to address this problem. SBE offers Build and Broaden in order to increase proposal submissions, advance research collaborations and networks involving MSI scholars, and support research activities in the SBE sciences at MSIs. Proposals that outline research projects in the SBE sciences that increase students' pursuit of graduate training, enhance PI productivity build research capacity, or cultivate partnerships are especially encouraged to apply. Proposals are invited from single principal investigators based at MSIs and from multiple co-investigators from groups of MSIs. Principal investigators who are not affiliated with MSIs may submit proposals, but must collaborate with PIs, co-PIs, or senior personnel from MSIs and describe how their project will foster research partnerships or capacity-building with at least one MSI as a primary goal of the proposed work. Proposals may address any scientific and cross-disciplinary areas supported by SBE. These areas include anthropology, archaeology, cognitive neuroscience, decision science, ecological research, economics, geography, linguistics, law and science, organizational behavior, political science, public policy, security and preparedness, psychology, and sociology.

The Mathematical Biology Program regularly seeks joint reviews of proposals with programs in the Directorates of Biological Sciences and Engineering. Investigators are encouraged to discuss their project with program officers in relevant areas to determine if it should be considered by more than one program. Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Investigators submitting an RUI proposal should read the RUI solicitation (link below), as the rules for proposal format may deviate from the Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG). EAGER and RAPID Proposals Prior to submitting proposals for EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) or Rapid Response Research (RAPID), Investigators must contact the cognizant program directors. Requests for Award Supplements Principal Investigatorsare encouraged to contact the cognizant program director prior to submission of a proposal for an award supplement. See the PAPPG for more information. Conferences Investigators should carefully read the program solicitation, ""Conferences and Workshops in the Mathematical Sciences,"" (link below) to obtain important information regarding the substance of proposals for conferences, workshops, summer/winter schools, and similar activities.

The program’s objectives are to: (1) build knowledge about how to develop preK-12 students’ and teachers’ STEM content knowledge, practices, and skills; (2) support collaborative partnerships among STEM education researchers, STEM education practitioners and school leaders with the goals of extending relevant scientific literatures while developing more effective practice; and (3) build the field of STEM education by supporting knowledge synthesis, interdisciplinary interactions across fields and stakeholders, and the development of novel and robust ways of assessing teacher and student learning, engagement, and skills. Outcomes of DRK-12 projects can include but are not limited to promising, evidence-based products that can be used by others to support the success of all teachers and all students (e.g., curriculum, teaching and research tools, and models of collaboration).\nThe program solicits proposals along two strands: (1) Learning and (2) Teaching. While these strands certainly overlap and have synergy, proposals should identify one strand that is most consistent with the proposal’s objectives and research questions (e.g., are the project’s methods and outcomes focused primarily on teacher development and teaching or student development and learning?). Research project types under both Strands include exploratory, design and development, impact, implementation, measurement and assessment, and synthesis studies. The program also supports other project types including Partnership Development Grants and Workshops/Conferences. Successful proposals demonstrate how they build on fundamental research in STEM education and on previous or current applied research and development efforts. They also explain their theoretical and empirical justification (e.g., Why is the project designed as it is?) and outline related specific aims and methods with potential to yield new understandings of STEM teaching and learning contexts, processes, and outcomes. The program welcomes proposals focused on teaching and learning in any STEM field(s) and on priorities identified in the National Science Foundation’s strategic plan. Efforts focused on facilitating the reciprocal exchange or mobilization of knowledge between the research and preK-12 formal education professional communities are strongly encouraged (see this Dear Colleague Letter https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23078/nsf23078.jsp).', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 23-596', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

By addressing priorities at the local scale that are relevant across the US, CIVIC is laying the foundation for a broader and more fluid exchange of research and technology capabilities and civic priorities through joint partnerships involving civic partners and the research community. CIVIC funds projects that pilot state-of-the-art solutions to community challenges over 12 months, following a six-month planning phase, and have the potential for lasting impact in the partnering community as well as the potential to be scaled and implemented in other communities. Additionally, the foundation for CIVIC projects should be rooted in maturing and transitioning state-of-the-art research in disciplines, including but not limited to computer science, engineering, geosciences, biological sciences, and social sciences. CIVIC is uniquely designed to enable transition to practice of innovations into communities, as follows: (1) CIVIC flips the community-university dynamic, by empowering communities and researchers to jointly identify civic priorities ripe for innovation and to address these priorities as equal partners; (2) CIVIC focuses on research-centered solutions that are ready for piloting in and with communities on a short timescale, where real-world outcomes can be evaluatedwithin 12 months; (3) CIVIC requires a coalition of communities and civic partners and a multi-disciplinary set of researchers to co-create and execute pilot projects; and (4) CIVIC organizes and fosters nationwide “communities of practice” around high-need problem areas that allow for meaningful knowledge sharing and cross-site collaboration during both the pre-development and piloting stages. For this solicitation, civic partnership and engagement activities, communities, and academic and civic partners must be based in the United States or its protectorates. For purposes of clarity, civic partners may include local, state, or tribal government officials; non-profit representatives; community organizers or advocates; community service providers; and/or others working to improve their communities. CIVIC is organized as a two-stage competition withtwo tracks centered around the following topic areas:\nTrack A. Climate and Environmental Instability - Building Resilient Communities through Co-Design, Adaption, and Mitigation\nTrack B. Bridging the gap between essential resources and services & community needs.\nIn Stage 1,approximately 35-40 Planning Grant awards will be made – each with a budget of up to $75,000 for six months to undertake planning and team development activities. These include solidifying the team, maturing the project plans, and preparing a well-developed full proposal for submission to Stage 2.Only Stage 1 CIVIC recipients can submit to the CIVIC Stage 2 competition. In Stage 2,approximately20 Full Awards will be made. These will be selected from Stage 1 award recipients. For Stage 2, proposals will be considered with budgets up to $1,000,000 for up to 12 months. Proposals must describe how the PIs will execute and evaluate their research-centered pilot projects. Throughout both stages, NSF award recipient (2223449) MetroLab Network (metrolabnetwork.org, nsfcivicinnovation.org) will foster “communities of practice” through in-person and virtual activities, aimed at enhancing the teams’ capacity-building, networking, impact, and ability to create methods and solutions transferable to other communities.

The program takes a comprehensive approach to the STEM Learning Ecosystem to impact STEM student development and retention. LSAMP is an alliance-based program, whereby a group of institutions of higher education (IHEs) work together to diversify the nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by increasing the number of STEM baccalaureate and graduate degrees awarded to persons from LSAMP populations. LSAMP populations are defined as persons from groups underrepresented in the STEM enterprise: Blacks and African-Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The LSAMP program provides funding to alliances that implement comprehensive, evidence-based, innovative, and sustained strategies that ultimately result in the graduation of well-prepared, highly competitive students from LSAMP populations who pursue graduate studies or careers in STEM, while also supporting knowledge generation, knowledge utilization, assessment of program impacts, dissemination activities and dissemination of scholarly research into the field. Projects supported by the LSAMP program include: --Alliance Development Grants (ADG) support the conceptualization and development of new B2B and new SPIO alliances. (New) --Bridge-to-the-Baccalaureate (B2B) alliances facilitate the successful transfer of students from LSAMP populations to four-year institutions in pursuit of STEM baccalaureate degrees. --STEM Pathways Implementation-Only (SPIO) alliances are designed for new and reconstituted alliances. These projects focus on building and strengthening strategies and approaches to assist Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) increase STEM baccalaureate degrees to LSAMP populations and facilitate entry into STEM graduate degree programs. --STEM Pathways Research Alliances (SPRA) are designed for well-established alliances. These projects serve as models of excellence in STEM broadening participation by (1) steadily increasing STEM baccalaureate degrees to LSAMP populations and facilitating entry into STEM graduate degree programs; (2) producing and disseminating new scholarly research on the broadening participation of LSAMP populations (or underrepresented and underserved populations in STEM disciplines and the nation's STEM workforce) and, (3) holistically assess the state of institutionalization and sustainability of the alliance. --Bridge to STEM Graduate Degrees in National Priorities (BD-Master's) projects support cohorts of six graduate students pursuing a M.

REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects specifically designed for the REU program. This solicitation features two mechanisms for supporting student research:\nREU Sites are based on independent proposals to initiate and conduct projects that engage a number of students in research. REU Sites may be based in a single discipline or academic department or may offer interdisciplinary or multi-department research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme.\nREU Supplements may be included as a component of proposals for new or renewal NSF grants or cooperative agreements or may be requested for ongoing NSF-funded research projects.\nREU projects with an international dimension are welcome. Undergraduate student participants in either REU Sites or REU Supplements must be U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals,or U.S. permanent residents. Students do not apply to NSF to participate in REU activities, and NSF does not select students for the opportunities. Investigators who receive REU awards establish their own process for receiving and reviewing applications and selecting students, and students follow the instructions provided by each REU Site or REU Supplement to apply. (In some cases, investigators pre-select students for REU Supplements.) To identify appropriate REU Sites, students should consult the directory of active REU Sites on the Web at https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.cfm.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Publication 23-601', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

Projects funded by the Social Psychology Program support the NSF mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and to secure the national defense. Proposals considered by the Social Psychology Program must communicate both the intellectual merit of the science and its broader societal impacts. Proposed research should carry strong potential for creating transformative advances in the basic understanding of human social behavior. Among the many research topics supported are social cognition, attitudes, social and cultural influence, stereotypes, motivation, decision making, group dynamics, aggression, close relationships, social and affective neuroscience, social psychophysiology, emotions, prosocial behavior, health-related behavior, and personality and individual differences. Proposals that develop new theories or methods for understanding social behavior are highly encouraged. Research samples should represent substantial ranges of ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, cultures and other dimensions of human populations. Interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and convergent research approaches are encouraged. Proposals involving non-human animals are considered only if the research offers clear and direct contributions to understanding human social behavior. The program does not fund research that seeks to improve clinical practice as its primary outcome, nor does it consider proposals with disease-related goals, including work on the etiology, diagnosis or treatment of physical or mental disease, abnormality or malfunction in human beings or animals. In assessing intellectual merit, the Social Psychology Program places highest priority on research that is theoretically grounded, based on empirical observation and validation, and with designs appropriate to the questions asked. In assessing broader impacts, the Social Psychology Program places highest priority on proposals that offer strong potential to benefit society, strengthen our national security interests, improve the quality of life, broaden participation in science, enhance infrastructure for research and education, and include a plan for sharing the results with a wide variety of audiences. The Social Psychology Program expects the methods, measures and data that result from NSF support to be openly shared with other researchers and the public. For further guidance proposers should consult Data Management for NSF SBE Directorate Proposals and Awards. The Data Management Plan should articulate how the proposed research will engage with best practices of open science. Researchers are expected to engage in open science practices, and deviations from that should be well-justified. The Social Psychology Program accepts regular research proposals, including Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) proposals, proposals for research in undergraduate institutions (RUI), rapid response research proposals (RAPID) and early-concept grants for exploratory research (EAGER). The program also accepts small conference proposals for events (including workshops) being planned one year or more after submission. The Social Psychology Program does not accept proposals for doctoral dissertation improvement awards. Investigators are encouraged to contact a Social Psychology program director before submitting a proposal to confirm its fit with the scope and priorities of the Social Psychology Program. Such contact will be most productive by sending a one-page (maximum) summary with an overview of the planned proposal, which includes a description of intellectual merit and broader impacts. The Social Psychology program is always interested in identifying new reviewers. Potential reviewers should have a Ph.D. in psychology or related field and have a demonstrated area of expertise relevant to social psychology. Individuals interested in reviewing for the program should send a short description of their areas of expertise (2 sentences) and their CV to a Social Psychology program director.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'NSF Program Desccription PD-22-1332', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nNSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov\n\nIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.'}"

","{'Agency Name:': 'National Science Foundation', 'Description:': ""The Linguistics Program supports basic science in the domain of human language, encompassing investigations of the grammatical properties of individual human languages, and of natural language in general. Research areas include syntax, semantics, morphology, phonetics and phonology. The program encourages projects that are interdisciplinary in methodological or theoretical perspective, and that address questions that cross disciplinary boundaries, such as (but not limited to):\nWhat are the psychological processes involved in the production, perception, and comprehension of language?\nWhat are the computational properties of language and/or the language processor that make fluent production, incremental comprehension or rapid learning possible?\nHow do the acoustic and physiological properties of speech inform our theories of natural language and/or language processing?\nWhat role does human neurobiology play in shaping the various grammatical properties of language?\nHow does language develop in natural learning contexts across the life-span?\nWhat social and cultural factors underlie language variation and change?\nBecause NSF's mandate is to support basic research, the Linguistics Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice or applied policy, nor does it support work to develop or assess pedagogical methods or tools for language instruction. The Linguistics Program accepts proposals for a variety of project types: research proposals from scholars with PhDs or equivalent degrees, proposals for Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (LING-DDRI) awards, and CAREER proposals. We will also consider proposals for conferences. Funding requests for conference support should be submitted in accordance with the Conference Proposals section of Chapter II of NSF's Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG). NSF's Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS), in partnership with the National Endowment for the Humanities and in collaboration with programs in other NSF Directorates, supports efforts to develop and advance knowledge and infrastructure that will enable the analysis of languages that are both understudied and at risk of falling out of use. In recognition of the critical relevance of these languages to understanding the range and limits of human linguistic and cultural variation, BCS accepts research and dissertation proposals in response to solicitations NSF Dynamic Language Infrastructure - NEH Documenting Endangered Languages (DLI-DEL) and Dynamic Language Infrastructure - Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DLI-DDRI).

DAC’s mission is to: Inform Army modernization and readiness decisions with objective Analysis enabled through Tool development and Data curation.\n  DAC partners across the national security enterprise to deliver fundamentally advantageous change that is rooted in the creation and exploitation of scientific knowledge. DAC accomplishes this mission by funding the areas of applied research (budget activity 6.2), as defined by 32 CFR 22.105, advanced technology development (budget activity 6.3), and advanced component development and prototypes (budget activity 6.4).\n  Whitepapers for initial concept reviews and full proposals are sought from institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, foreign organizations, foreign public entities, and for-profit organizations (i.e. large and small businesses) for scientific research that supports the DAC mission. The DAC BAA generally conforms to the portfolio structured around research area based mission execution. Whitepapers and full proposals are expected to be for cutting-edge innovative research that could produce discoveries with a significant impact to enable new and improved Army technologies and related operational capabilities and related technologies.\n  In an effort to provide DAC's research topics and related information in an easy to digest format, DAC has published the following public website listing all current DAC research topics: https://www.army.mil/article/261533, hereafter referenced as the DAC BAA topics website. DAC focuses on executing in-house research programs but supplements our efforts with support from the broader technology base and Academia. DAC funds a modest amount of extramural research in certain specific areas, and those areas are described on the DAC BAA topics website. Changes to these topics will be made using this website on an as needed basis. A change to the DAC BAA topics website is not an amendment to this BAA and will not be posted on https://www.grants.gov/ and https://sam.gov/. A change to this document, the BAA itself, is an amendment and will be posted on https://www.grants.gov/ and https://sam.gov/. DAC will maintain a daily static snapshot of the DAC BAA topics website to ensure submissions are aligned with listed research topics on the day of submission.\n  Interested parties are encouraged to continually browse the DAC BAA topics website for white paper and proposal topics that DAC desires to explore. These specific research topics should be viewed as suggestive, rather than limiting. DAC is always interested in considering other innovative research concepts of relevance to the Army if those concepts align with DAC's mission. Please see Section II, Detailed Information about the Funding Opportunity, for more information on the DAC research topics advertised through this BAA.

The EBRC brings together universities, research institutions, companies, and individual scholars and supports multidisciplinary and cross-institutional projects addressing specific topic areas determined by the Department of the Army (DA). The EBRC aims to promote research in specific areas of EMs and to promote a candid and constructive relationship between DA and the energetics research community.\n The future Army is projected to be unable to achieve dominance in range and lethality due to inadequate energetic formulations and form factor limitations associated with current weapon systems. Basic research generates new knowledge that may be exploited to develop and deliver new materials and technologies that contribute to enhanced lethal effects at the system level as well as increased range and a smaller payload. These, in turn, enable space for larger, mission-critical systems, and shorter time-to-target ensuring Army battlefield dominance in Multi-Domain Operations. Army research must encompass new ways to expedite the discovery, design, and scale-up of new materials and concepts which when integrated into newly designed weapons components (e.g. additively manufactured high strength steels with pre-formed fragmentation patterns, and structural reactive materials) developed at ARL and across the Army and DoD communities, will deliver decisive weapons overmatch."", 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nSchon Zwakman\nGrantor\nPhone 919-541-4722\n\nArmy Contracting/Grants Officer'}"

Recognizing that USAID’s work is “from the\nAmerican people” to the people of the world, NPI emphasizes the need to be equally\naccountable to the people in the communities in which we work as well as to the\nAmerican taxpayer.\n● Seek innovative approaches. NPI capitalizes on the full marketplace of ideas and\nsolutions by collaborating with partners from all sectors of society, while developing\npartnerships that foster mutual accountability and develop local capacity.\n● Lower barriers to partnerships. NPI identifies processes, norms, and regulations that\nprohibit potential partnerships and finds ways to mitigate them while maintaining\nappropriate safeguards on taxpayer resources.\n● Identify new and nontraditional sources of funding.

Proposed research can be aligned with TBI, psychological health, or in combination.\n\nClinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), diagnostics, devices, therapies, clinical guidance, behavioral interventions, emerging approaches and technologies, and/or new indications for products currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -cleared. Interventions that are not FDA-regulated (or international equivalent) are within scope but the regulatory status must be documented in Attachment 8, Regulatory Strategy. Proposed projects may range from small proof-of-concept trials (e.g., pilot, first-in-human, phase 0) to demonstrate feasibility or inform the design of more advanced trials through large-scale trials to determine efficacy in relevant patient populations.\nFunding from this award mechanism must support a clinical trial. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials.\nFor more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document_DEC2022.pdf.\nPrincipal Investigators (PIs) proposing comparative effectiveness, implementation science, health care services research as the primary research objective should consider the FY24 TBIPHRP Health Services Research Award (Funding Opportunity Number HT942524TBIPHRPHSRA). PIs seeking funding for a preclinical research project should consider one of the other FY24 TBPHRP program announcements.\nKey aspects of the FY24 TBIPHRP CTA:\n• Clinical Trial Start Date: The proposed clinical trial is expected to begin no later than 6 months after the award date for studies regulated by the Regulatory Agency.\n• Preliminary data are required: Inclusion of preliminary data relevant to the proposed clinical trial is required.\n• Community-Based Participatory Research: The application/proposal must include Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approaches in the development and execution of the clinical trial. CBPR approaches should be documented in Attachment 13.\n• Study Population: The application should demonstrate the availability of and access to a suitable patient population that will support a meaningful outcome for the study. The application should include a discussion of how accrual goals will be achieved, as well as the strategy for inclusion of women and minorities in the clinical trial appropriate to the objectives of the study. Studies utilizing human biospecimens or datasets that cannot be linked to a specific individual, gender, ethnicity, or race (typically classified as exempt from Institutional Review Board [IRB] review) are exempt from this requirement.\n• Intervention Availability: The application/proposal should demonstrate the documented availability of and access to the drug/compound, device, and/or other materials needed, as appropriate, for the proposed duration of the study.\n• Personnel and Environment: The application/proposal should demonstrate the study team’s expertise and experience in all aspects of conducting clinical trials, including appropriate statistical analysis, knowledge of Regulatory Agency processes (if applicable), and data management. The application/proposal should include a study coordinator(s) who will guide the clinical protocol through the local IRB of record and other federal agency regulatory approval processes, coordinate activities from all sites participating in the trial, and coordinate participant accrual. The application/proposal should show strong institutional support and, if applicable, a commitment to serve as the regulatory sponsor, ensuring all sponsor responsibilities described in 21 CFR 312, Subpart D, for FDA-regulated studies.\n• Innovative Clinical Trial Design: When appropriate, the TBIPHRP encourages the use of innovative clinical trial design approaches (e.g., Bayesian, adaptive, clinical bioequivalence, seamless, exploratory/phase 0, basket, stepped wedge) that improve efficiency and ability to determine clinical benefit while maintaining validity, integrity, and ethical considerations.\n• Precision Medicine Approaches: When appropriate, the TBIPHRP encourages the use of precision medicine approaches. These tailored treatments deliver the right treatment at the right time while considering an individual’s unique characteristics.\n• Statistical Analysis and Data Management Plans: The application/proposal should include a clearly articulated statistical analysis plan, a power analysis reflecting sample size projections that will answer the objectives of the study, and a data management plan that includes use of an appropriate database to safeguard and maintain the integrity of the data. If required by a Regulatory Agency, the trial must use a 21 CFR 11-compliant database and appropriate data standards.\nFor the purposes of this funding opportunity Regulatory Agency refers to the FDA or any relevant international regulatory agency unless otherwise noted.\nIf the proposed clinical trial involves the use of a drug that has not been approved by the relevant Regulatory Agency for the country where the research will be conducted, then submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, or equivalent, that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 312 may be required.\n• It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence from the IRB of record or the relevant Regulatory Agency if an IND, or equivalent, is not required. If an IND, or equivalent, is required, the regulatory application must be approved/cleared/authorized or submitted to the relevant Regulatory Agency within the first 60 days of the award.\n• The investigational drug application, or equivalent, should be specific for the product and indication to be tested in the proposed clinical trial. For more information on FDA IND applications specifically, the FDA has provided guidance at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application.\nIf the investigational product is a device, then submission of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), or equivalent, application that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 812 may be required.\n• It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence if an IDE, or equivalent, is not required. If an IDE, or equivalent, is required, the IDE application, or equivalent, must be approved/cleared/authorized or submitted to the relevant Regulatory Agency within the first 60 days of the award. • The investigational device application, or equivalent, should be specific for the device and indication to be tested in the proposed clinical trial. For more information on FDA IDE applications specifically, the FDA has provided guidance at\nhttps://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-submissions-selecting-and-preparing-correct-submission/investigational-device-exemption-ide.\nIf the proposed clinical trial of an investigational product will be conducted at international sites, evidence that an application to the relevant national regulatory agency of the host country(ies) has been approved/cleared/authorized or submitted within the first 60 days of the award within Attachment 8, Regulatory Strategy.\nResearch Levels: The following are general descriptions, although not all-inclusive, of the scope of research projects that would be appropriate to propose under the current BAA. Only one Research Level category may be chosen per application. It is the responsibility of the applicant to select the level that aligns with the scope of the proposed research. The Research Level should be selected based on the research scope and not on the amount of the budget. Refer to Section II.D.6, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information.\n• Research Level 1: Research Level 1 is intended to support proof-of-principle pilot studies, phase 0/small phase 1 trials, correlative studies related to an intervention, and other innovative, exploratory clinical trials. The maximum period of performance is 3 years. The application/proposal’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $500,000.\n○ Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option: The FY24 TBIPHRP CTA (Research Level 1 only) includes an Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option that is structured to accommodate two PIs, one of whom is an Early-Career Investigator. The combined direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance in the proposals/applications of the Initiating PI and Partnering PI should not exceed $500,000.\n– The PIs may have experience in similar or disparate scientific disciplines, but each PI is expected to bring distinct contributions to the application/proposal. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for most of the administrative tasks associated with application/proposal submission. The other investigator will be the Partnering PI. At least one of the Initiating or Partnering PIs must be an Early-Career Investigator.\n– The intent is not to create mentor-mentee arrangement. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project, including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. The application/proposal is expected to describe how the PIs’ unique experience/expertise combined as a partnership will better address the research question, how the unique experience/expertise that each individual brings to the application/proposal is critical for the research strategy and completion of the SOW, and why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts. – If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization(s). For individual DOD FY24 TBIPHRP CTA submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI, refer to\nSection II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application/proposal Submission.\n• Research Level 2: Research Level 2 is intended to support phase 1 and more advanced clinical trials for promising interventions. The maximum period of performance is 4 years. The application/proposal’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $2.0M.\n• Research Level 3: Research Level 3 is intended to support larger-scale clinical trials that demonstrate efficacy in relevant patient populations. The maximum period of performance is 4 years. The application/proposal’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $4.0M.\nRelevance to Military Health: Relevance to the health care needs of Service Members, their Families, and Veterans is a key feature of this award. Investigators are encouraged to consider the following characteristics as examples of how a project may demonstrate relevance to military health:\n• Explanation of how the project addresses an aspect of psychological health conditions and/or TBI that has direct relevance to the health and/or readiness of Service Members, their Families, and Veterans.\n• Description of how the knowledge, information, products, or technologies gained from the proposed research could be implemented in a dual-use capacity to benefit the civilian population and also address a military need.\n• Use of military or Veteran populations, samples, or datasets in the proposed research, if appropriate.\nCollaborations between researchers or consultants at military or Veterans organizations and non-military organizations are encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique data and research resources that the partners bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing TBI and psychological health research of significance to Service Members, their Families, and Veterans. A list of websites that may be useful in identifying additional information about ongoing DOD and VA areas of research interest or potential opportunities for collaboration can be found in Appendix 2.\n\nAwards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025.\nThe CDMRP expects to allot approximately $58.9M to fund approximately 4 Research Level 1, 10 Research Level 2, and 4 Research Level 3 FY24 TBIPHRP CTA proposals/ applications. Funding of applications/proposals received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications/proposals received, the quality and merit of the applications/proposals as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds.

Although Uzbekistan has implemented reforms to boost its anti-money laundering (AML) framework, the country still faces significant challenges in combating money laundering and financial crimes, which threaten the integrity of its financial system, facilitate corruption, and hinder economic development. Despite ongoing efforts, the country continues to grapple with issues related to illicit financial flows, corruption, and weak regulatory frameworks. These challenges are exacerbated by the complex and evolving nature of money laundering schemes, which often exploit gaps in the existing legal and institutional structures. To address these issues, there is a critical need for innovative and effective anti-money laundering (AML) initiatives that can strengthen Uzbekistan’s capacity to detect, prevent, and prosecute financial crimes. This funding opportunity seeks to support projects that enhance regulatory compliance, improve coordination among relevant agencies, and promote the adoption of international best practices in AML. By investing in these efforts, INL aims to bolster Uzbekistan’s financial integrity, strengthen the rule of law, and contribute to a more transparent and resilient economic environment.', 'Link to Additional Information:': 'Link to Opportunity in MyGrants', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nTashkentINL@state.gov'}"

This award supports the development of translational research collaborations between two independent investigators to address a central problem or question in pancreatic cancer in a manner that would be less readily achievable through separate efforts. One partner in the collaboration must function as a research scientist and the other partner as a clinician investigator. It should be clear that both have had equal intellectual input in the design of the research project. Projects involving convergence science partnerships are strongly encouraged. At least one partner must have expertise either in pancreatic cancer research or pancreatic cancer patient care. Inclusion of experts from outside the pancreatic cancer field is encouraged. A proposed project in which the clinical partner merely supplies tissue samples or access to patients will not meet the intent of this award mechanism. Full support for large-scale clinical trials is not expected; retrospective tissue analysis, correlative studies, or small pilot clinical trials are permitted.\n\nSignificant features of the Translational Research Partnership Award:\n\nPartnership: The success of the project should depend on the unique skills and contributions of each partner.\n\nTranslation: The application should provide evidence for the reciprocal transfer of information between basic and clinical science, or vice versa, in developing and implementing the research plan. Translational research may include correlative studies and/or development of or use of annotated biorepositories. The application should demonstrate how the study will leverage clinical information to address knowledge gaps in resulting outcomes, validate key research findings, expand upon potentially transformative results, and/or investigate novel findings.\n\nImpact: The proposed research should indicate the potential to have a significant impact on pancreatic cancer research and/or patient care and have the potential to accelerate the movement of promising ideas (in prevention, diagnosis, detection, prognosis, treatment, and/or survivorship) into clinical applications.\n\nFeasibility: The application should demonstrate that the investigators have access to the necessary specimens, data, and/or intervention, as applicable.\n\nPreliminary Data: Published and/or unpublished results from the laboratory of the Principal Investigators (PIs) or collaborators named on the application that are relevant to pancreatic cancer and the proposed research project, are required.\n\nPreliminary data to support the feasibility of the research hypothesis(es) and research approaches are required; however, these data do not necessarily need to be derived from studies of pancreatic cancer.\n\nObservations that drive a research idea may be derived from a laboratory discovery, population-based studies, or a clinician’s firsthand knowledge of patients and anecdotal data. The ultimate goal of translational research is to move a concept or observation forward into clinical application that is relevant to active-duty Service Members, Veterans, other military beneficiaries, and the American public. However, translational research should not be viewed as a one-way continuum from bench to bedside. The research plan must involve a reciprocal flow of ideas and information between basic and clinical science. There should be an intellectual synergistic partnership between the clinic and the laboratory.\n\nThe success of the project must be supported by the unique skills and contributions of each partner. The proposed study must include clearly stated plans for interactions between the PIs and the institutions involved.

In addition, there are seven Scholars with active awards from FY22 who would join the VCC under the auspices of the FY24 VCCDA. The VCC will provide intensive mentoring, national networking, collaborative opportunities, and a peer group for Scholars.\nThe Director and Deputy Director (referred to as the VCC Leadership) will catalyze the growth and professional development of the Scholars, promote the cross pollination of different cancer disciplines, assess the progress of the Scholars, and facilitate communication and collaboration among all of the VCC members. The VCC will give the Scholars opportunities to operate in a collegial, highly dynamic, and cutting-edge center to lead cancer research to a new frontier.\n This FY24 Funding Opportunity is soliciting applications for a Director and Deputy Director to design and implement the VCC. The Director and Deputy Director must be established cancer researchers, be at different institutions, and be in different cancer disciplines along the cancer care spectrum. The VCC Leadership must demonstrate a strong record of mentoring and training early career investigators, a commitment to leadership, and the ability to objectively assess the progress of all of the Scholars in the VCC. It is the intention that through the VCC, collaborations will foster new growth in different cancers and spur and integrated cancer center to ensure the research advancements across different cancer centers.\nThe Virtual Cancer Center Director Award is structured to support two Principal Investigators (PIs). The Director will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The Deputy Director will be identified as the Partnering PI. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development and execution of the VCC. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI(s), refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission.\nThe application should clearly demonstrate that both PIs have equal levels of input on the proposed VCC Leadership and clearly define the components to be addressed by each to continue the success of Scholars. While it is up to the Director and Deputy Director to define their roles, both VCC Leaders should have interactions with the Scholars; acting as administrative support does not fulfill the intent of the Deputy Director.\nA portion of the total direct budget costs (no more than 15%) must be reserved to support the collaborative “seed projects.” Seed projects should be collaborative projects conceived and proposed by a minimum of two current Scholars. The VCC Leadership will be responsible for developing the intent of the seed projects, the submission requirements, and coordinating and funding a scientific peer review of projects proposed for funding during the period of performance.\nThe PRCRP seeks to promote novel approaches to ending cancer through convergent science cancer research. Convergent science as defined by the National Science Foundation (https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence/index.jsp) “is a means of solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and forming novel frameworks to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation.” Convergent science taps into a variety of disciplines to answer the issues in cancer (i.e., prevention, diagnosis/detection, treatment, quality of life, disparities) including but not limited to biomedical sciences, data science, engineering, psychology, and chemistry. Convergent science breaks down the barriers of cancer research and builds a whole answer with tools from different areas of expertise. Investigators applying to the VCCDA are encouraged, but not required, to integrate convergent science in the design of the VCC.', 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nCDMRP Help Desk\nPhone: 301-682-5507\nEmail: help@eBRAP.org\n\nCDMRP Help Desk'}"

The BMFRP recognizes the scientific and financial challenges associated with advancing promising, potentially life-changing, therapeutic agents from the laboratory to clinical evaluation. Data related to lead compound characterization; formulation and stability; absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion; dose/response; and toxicology are required before clinical trials can commence. The proposed studies under the FL2 IND-enabling efforts are expected to be empirical in nature, product-driven, and focused on the accumulation of data for a lead therapeutic candidate that will be included in an IND application submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). At least one and no more than three lead therapeutic candidates must be named at the time of application submission to meet the intent of the FL2 mechanism.

By supporting exploration (i.e., examining unknown or poorly understood areas of the seafloor, sub-bottom, or water column through initial assessments of the physical, chemical, geological, biological, archaeological, or other characteristics), NOAA Ocean Exploration seeks to advance our basic understanding of the unknown ocean. \nAll proposed projects must support priorities in the NOAA Ocean Exploration Strategic Plan (https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/about/what-we-do/media/noaa-oe-strategic-plan_fy23-fy27.pdf) and should also consider the Strategic Priorities for Ocean Exploration and Characterization of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NOMEC_OEC_Priorities_Report.pdf). Proposed projects are not restricted to waters under U.S. jurisdiction, but proposals should address how projects will provide national benefit.\nFor Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) funding, NOAA Ocean Exploration is soliciting proposals focused on one of the following two themes:\nOCEAN EXPLORATION: Ocean Exploration proposals should support exploration of unknown or poorly known ocean areas, processes, or resources in waters deeper than 200 meters or in tropical mesophotic environments. Projects can entail conducting ocean exploration (e.g., mapping and characterizing ocean habitats, combining seismic and acoustic methods), advancing ocean exploration through the use or development of novel technologies (e.g., autonomous systems, nondestructive sensors, artificial intelligence/machine learning), and/or analysis of ocean exploration datasets or samples that already exist and are publicly accessible. NOAA Ocean Exploration is particularly interested in projects that explore the physical, chemical, and biological environments and processes in the deep oceanic water column and projects that will improve genetic libraries for species-level environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis of deep-sea species. All proposals must demonstrate how the proposed project relates to at least one of the exploration variables identified by NOAA Ocean Exploration (https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/data/publications/exploration-variables.html).\nMARITIME HERITAGE: Maritime Heritage proposals should address the exploration for significant maritime heritage resources that improve our understanding of the past and inform decisions about management and preservation. Maritime heritage projects can be conducted at any water depth. NOAA Ocean Exploration is particularly interested in proposals that target conflict archaeology, incorporate Indigenous knowledge, or perform wide-area searches in areas poorly mapped for maritime heritage. NOAA Ocean Exploration welcomes the use of innovative technology and/or methods for quantitative assessment of targets to improve archaeological site identification and documentation.\nInformational documents about this funding opportunity are on the NOAA Ocean Exploration website at https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/about/funding-opps/welcome.html.\nAll links were valid as of the date of the publication of this notice.

To identify an overarching challenge or question that meets the intent of the FTTSA, investigators are strongly encouraged to consider barrier(s) to and/or gap(s) in the understanding, prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, and/or treatment of eye injury or visual dysfunction associated with military exposure and envision what may be achievable in 10 to 15 years. Based on the long-term expectation, investigators will identify what should and can be achieved in the short term and will design projects and research teams around these goals.\n• Research Projects\n○ Applications shall include at least three but no more than five distinct research projects that together form a concerted and synergistic effort to address the overarching challenge. Each project, as well as the overall effort, must align with one or more of the FY24 VRP Focus Areas. The potential topics of individual projects are wide-ranging. The examples provided below are illustrative and not exhaustive:\n− Elucidation of molecular, cellular, and biophysical mechanisms of eye injury or visual dysfunction associated with military exposure\n− Identification of significant changes in pathophysiology over time after military exposure to inform targeted treatments\n− Identification of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets\n− Development and validation of therapeutic agents and/or devices\nDOD FY24 Vision Focused Translational Team Science Award 5\n− Development and validation of drug delivery platforms appropriate for eye injury or visual dysfunction associated with military exposure\n− Development or improvement of clinically relevant trauma models\n− Design of protection to mitigate the impact of military exposure on eye and vision\n− Development of lightweight portable assessment or diagnostic capability\n○ Individual projects must be capable of standing on their own scientific merits. The FY24 VRP FTTSA is not intended to support a series of research projects dependent on the success of any other project. Each project should propose a unique approach to address the overarching challenge and be capable of producing research findings with potential to impact the visual system trauma research field and/or patient care. Preliminary data to support the feasibility of each proposed research project are required.\n○ Individual research projects may focus on any phase of research (e.g., basic, translational, applied, clinical, observational). The FY24 VRP FTTSA allows one of the projects to include a pilot clinical trial (PCT), but not a full-scale clinical trial. In contrast to full-scale clinical trials that are designed to determine safety or efficacy, the purpose of the PCT is to inform the feasibility, rationale, and design of subsequent clinical trials through limited clinical testing of a novel intervention. Applications that do include a PCT as part of the proposed research will have additional submission requirements and review criteria and should demonstrate sufficient understanding of regulatory approval requirements and the regulatory approval process.\n• Implementation: The research strategy to address the overarching challenge should include a detailed implementation plan for participating research groups to coordinate efforts, facilitate collaboration, and create synergy through open and frequent communication, interaction, sharing of results/data/resources, and other means as applicable and necessary. The coordination, collaboration, and synergy are intended to advance a solution beyond what would be possible through individual efforts.\n• Research Team: (New in FY24) The FY24 FTTSA is structured to have an Overall Lead Principal Investigator (PI) and multiple Project PIs. The Overall Lead PI will lead the overall effort as well as the execution of one project. The Overall Lead PI must have demonstrated success in leading large collaborative research project(s). Leaders of the other projects will be designated as Project PIs. Each PI may lead no more than one project.\no The Overall Lead PI will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. Project PIs will have their own submission requirements. If recommended for funding, all PIs will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s).

For individual submission requirements for the Overall Lead PI and Project PIs, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission.\nDOD FY24 Vision Focused Translational Team Science Award 6\no All key personnel should be committed to regular and open discussions of research plans, exchange of ideas, sharing of expertise and results, and other collaborative efforts. The CDMRP Science Officer assigned to a resulting award must be invited to participate in periodic research team meetings. The plan for such meetings should be noted in the application.\nA clinical trial is defined in 45 CFR 46.102 as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that retrospectively analyze data generated from previously conducted clinical trial(s) are not considered a clinical trial.\nFor the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research.

This mechanism seeks to promote novel approaches to ending cancer through convergent science cancer research. Convergent science as defined by the National Science Foundation (https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence/index.jsp) “is a means of solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and forming novel frameworks to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation.” Convergent science taps into a variety of disciplines to answer the issues in cancer (i.e., prevention, diagnosis/detection, treatment, quality of life, disparities) including but not limited to biomedical sciences, data science, engineering, psychology, and chemistry. Convergent science breaks down the barriers of cancer research and builds a whole answer with tools from different areas of expertise.\nThe CSCCA application must identify one of the FY24 Overarching Challenges as a unifying Focal Point for the consortium, and a minimum of three research projects addressing the Focal Point. Additionally, applicants must clearly define how their application investigates at least three different FY24 PRCRP Topic Areas. For example, brain cancer, neuroblastoma, and pediatric brain tumors are three of the FY24 PRCRP Topic Areas and would be acceptable. Three different types of pediatric brain tumors (i.e., pediatric medulloblastomas, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and pediatric astrocytomas) are not considered three different FY24 PRCRP Topic Areas and would not be acceptable. The proposed Convergent Science consortium should demonstrate the potential to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation, significantly advance cancer research, and have a profound positive impact on the lives of cancer patients or those at risk for cancer including Service Members, their Families, other military beneficiaries, and the American public.\nConsumer advocates should be integrated into and play an active role in the leadership and decision-making for the consortium. An individual advocate can only serve as an advisor and team member at one Research Site. The advocates must be cancer patients or a caretaker of patients from the FY24 PRCRP Topic Areas, be active in a cancer advocacy organization, and possess a high level of familiarity with current issues in cancer research. The advocates’ role should be independent of their employment with a participating institution.', 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nCDMRP Help Desk\nPhone: 301-682-5507\nEmail: help@eBRAP.org\n\nCDMRP Help Desk'}"

Risks of flooding and inundation present the region with economic, health, safety, and security challenges. As part of its mission to provide secure and timely access to global environmental data and information from satellites and other sources, NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) is working to enhance flood monitoring capabilities in Alaska.\nThis award will provide Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding for grantees to acquire and evaluate the potential of using commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to help monitor the extent and impacts of flooding in Alaskan communities. NOAA’s current flood monitoring products for Alaska have significant limitations as compared to capabilities possible over the contiguous United States. Challenges include limited satellite data coverage, frequent cloud cover, snow melt, dense forest cover, ice jams, un-managed rivers, and limited user access. Acquisition and evaluation of SAR imagery through this award will explore how to address these challenges, improving utilization of satellite observations and enhancing data accessibility. \nSatellites with SAR sensors measure how energy reflects off the Earth to map surface features such as rivers, land, and floodwaters. Currently, SAR observations in Alaska are limited to coastal areas. There is limited SAR imagery coverage over Central Alaskan rivers, delaying the ability for emergency management personnel and forecasters to address the flood impacts. Additionally, current SAR observations can lack the resolution, low latency, frequencies, polarizations, and swath width to provide the timely and actionable data needed to support flood hazards. Adding targeted SAR observations from commercial imagery may address observation gaps.\nAs authorized by the IRA, P.L. 117-169, Section 40004, this NOFO aligns with the direction to “accelerate advances in research, observation systems, modeling, forecasting, assessments, and dissemination of information to the public.” Funds will support products and information that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), analysis-ready, actionable, and authoritative."", 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nSean Helfrich, Water Surface Conditions (WSC)/SAR Applications Lead, at sean.helfrich@noaa.gov or (301) 683-3328 and Rachel Zinn at Rachel.C.Zinn@noaa.gov, Program Analyst.\n\nBusiness'}"

Findings from the FY24 ETRA-funded research should ultimately support the generation of new or updated clinical applications, health care products, and clinical practice guidelines for Service Members, their Families, Veterans, and the American public.\nResearch Scope: Applications to the FY24 TBIPHRP ETRA may include preclinical applied research (including animal research) and clinical research (including clinical trials). Applications must not include basic research21. The FY24 TBIPHRP ETRA may also support ancillary studies that are associated with an ongoing or completed clinical trial and projects that optimize the design of future clinical trials. This award may not be used to support studies requiring an exception from informed consent (EFIC). Clinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), diagnostics, devices, therapies, clinical guidance, behavioral interventions, emerging approaches and technologies, and/or new indications for products currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -cleared.\nA clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document.pdf.\nFor the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes:\n(1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies.\n(2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention.\n(3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial.\nExcluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule.\nApplications that include a clinical trial as part of the proposed research will have additional submission requirements and review criteria. For more information, see Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission and Section II.E.1, Criteria. Funded clinical trials are required to post a copy of the informed consent form used to enroll subjects on a publicly available federal website in accordance with federal requirements described in the 32 CFR 219.\nMulti-Institutional Clinical Research/Trials: As of January 20, 2020, U.S. institutions engaged in non-exempt cooperative research must rely on a single Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review and approve the portion of the research conducted at domestic sites (45 CFR 46.114(b)). If the proposed, non-exempt research involves more than one U.S.-based institution, a written plan for single IRB review arrangements must be provided at the time of application submission or award negotiation. The lead institution responsible for developing the master protocol and master consent form should be identified and should be the single point of contact for regulatory submissions and requirements.\nCommunication and data transfer between or among the collaborating institutions, as well as how specimens and/or imaging products obtained during the study will be handled, should be included in the appropriate sections of the application. A separate intellectual and material property plan agreed on by all participating institutions is also required for multi-institutional clinical research/trials.\nResearch Levels: The FY24 TBIPHRP ETRA offers funding for two Research Levels (refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions). Only one Research Level category may be chosen per application. It is the responsibility of the applicant to select the level that aligns with the scope of the proposed research. The Research Level should be selected based on the research scope and not on the amount of the budget. The following are generalized descriptions of the scope of the research appropriate for each Research level:\n• Research Level 1: Research Level 1 is intended to support smaller scope, less complex preclinical clinical research, or pilot/exploratory clinical trials. The maximum period of performance is 3 years. The application’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $700,000.\n• Research Level 2: Research Level 2 is intended to support larger scope, more complex preclinical, clinical research, or clinical trials. The maximum period of performance is 4 years. The application’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $1.5M.\no Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option: The FY24 TBIPHRP ETRA (Research Level 2 only) includes an Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option that is structured to accommodate two Principal Investigators (PIs), one of whom is an Early-Career Investigator. The combined direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance in the applications of the Initiating PI and Partnering PI should not exceed $1.5M. o The PIs may have experience in similar or disparate scientific disciplines, but each PI is expected to bring distinct contributions to the application. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for most of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other investigator will be the Partnering PI. At least one of the Initiating or Partnering PIs must be an Early-Career Investigator.\no The intent is not to create mentor-mentee arrangement. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project, including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. The application is expected to describe how the PIs’ unique experience/expertise combined as a partnership will better address the research question, how the unique experience/expertise that each individual brings to the application is critical for the research strategy and completion of the SOW, and why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts.\no If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization(s). For individual FY24 TBIPHRP ETRA submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission.\nRigor of Preclinical Research Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Projects that include research on animal models are required to submit Attachment 9, Animal Research Plan, as part of the application package to describe how these standards will be addressed. Applicants should consult the ARRIVE guidelines 2.0 (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) to ensure relevant aspects of rigorous animal research are adequately planned for and, ultimately, reported. The ARRIVE guidelines 2.0 can be found at https://arriveguidelines.org/arrive-guidelines.\nIf animal models are proposed, consider the following:\n• Pairing clinical populations to animal models in order to validate the clinical relevance and development of prevention, assessment, and treatment solutions is encouraged.\n• Proposed animal models should be well justified, supported within the literature, and clearly align with clinical relevance to the human condition.\nRelevance to Military Health: Relevance to the health care needs of Service Members, their Families, and Veterans is a key feature of this award. Investigators are encouraged to consider the following characteristics as examples of how a project may demonstrate relevance to military health:\n• Explanation of how the project addresses an aspect of psychological health conditions and/or TBI that has direct relevance to the health and/or readiness of Service Members, their Families, and Veterans.\n• Description of how the knowledge, information, products, or technologies gained from the proposed research could be implemented in a dual-use capacity to benefit the civilian population and also address a military need.\n• Use of military or Veteran populations, samples, or datasets in the proposed research, if appropriate.\nCollaborations between researchers or consultants at military or Veterans organizations and non-military organizations are strongly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique data and research resources that the partners bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing TBI and psychological health research of significance to Service Members, their Families, and Veterans. A list of websites that may be useful in identifying additional information about ongoing DOD and VA areas of research interest or potential opportunities for collaboration can be found in Appendix 2.\nAwards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025.\nThe CDMRP expects to allot approximately $16.0M to fund approximately four ETRA Research Level 1 applications and five ETRA Research Level 2 applications. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.', 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nCDMRP Help Desk\nPhone: 301-682-5507\nEmail: help@eBRAP.org\n\nCDMRP Help Desk'}"

Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies.\n(2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention.\n(3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial.\nExcluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule.\nApplications that include a clinical trial as part of the proposed research will have additional submission requirements and review criteria. For more information, see Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission and Section II.E.1, Criteria. Funded clinical trials are required to post a copy of the informed consent form used to enroll subjects on a publicly available federal website in accordance with federal requirements described in 32 CFR 219.\nMulti-Institutional Clinical Research/Trials: As of January 20, 2020, U.S. institutions engaged in non-exempt cooperative research must rely on a single Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review and approve the portion of the research conducted at domestic sites (45 CFR 46.114(b)). If the proposed, non-exempt research involves more than one U.S.-based institution, a written plan for single IRB review arrangements must be provided at the time of application submission or award negotiation. The lead institution responsible for developing the master protocol and master consent form should be identified and should be the single point of contact for regulatory submissions and requirements.\nCommunication and data transfer between or among the collaborating institutions, as well as how specimens and/or imaging products obtained during the study will be handled, should be included in the appropriate sections of the application. A separate intellectual and material property plan agreed on by all participating institutions is also required for multi-institutional clinical research/trials.\nResearch Levels: The FY24 TBIPHRP TRA offers funding for two Research Levels (refer to Section II.D.5 Funding Restrictions). Only one Research Level category may be chosen per application. It is the responsibility of the applicant to select the level that aligns with the scope of the proposed research. The Research Level should be selected based on the research scope and not on the amount of the budget. The following are generalized descriptions of the scope of the research appropriate for each Research level:\n• Research Level 1: Research Level 1 is intended to support smaller scope, less complex preclinical and/or clinical research. Pilot clinical trials as part of the proposed research are allowed. The maximum period of performance is 3 years. The application’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $500,000.\n• Research Level 2: Research Level 2 is intended to support larger scope, more complex preclinical and/or clinical research. Pilot clinical trials as part of the proposed research are allowed. The maximum period of performance is 4 years. The application’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $1.0M.\no Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option: The FY24 TBIPHRP TRA (Research Level 2 only) includes an Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option that is structured to accommodate two Principal Investigators (PIs), one of whom is an Early-Career Investigator. The combined direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance in the applications of the Initiating PI and Partnering PI should not exceed $1.0M.\no The PIs may have experience in similar or disparate scientific disciplines, but each PI is expected to bring distinct contributions to the application. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for most of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other investigator will be the Partnering PI. At least one of the Initiating or Partnering PIs must be an Early-Career Investigator.\no The intent is not to create a mentor-mentee arrangement. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project, including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. The application is expected to describe how the PIs’ unique experience/expertise combined as a partnership will better address the research question, how the unique experience/expertise that each individual brings to the application is critical for the research strategy and completion of the SOW, and why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts. o If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization(s). For individual FY24 TBIPHRP TRA submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI, refer to\nSection II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission.\nRigor of Preclinical Research Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Projects that include research on animal models are required to submit Attachment 9, Animal Research Plan, as part of the application package to describe how these standards will be addressed. Applicants should consult the ARRIVE guidelines 2.0 (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) to ensure relevant aspects of rigorous animal research are adequately planned for and, ultimately, reported. The ARRIVE guidelines 2.0 can be found at https://arriveguidelines.org/arrive-guidelines.\nIf animal models are proposed, consider the following:\n• Pairing clinical populations to animal models in order to validate the clinical relevance and development of prevention, assessment, and treatment solutions is encouraged.\n• Proposed animal models should be well justified, supported within the literature, and clearly align with clinical relevance to the human condition.\nRelevance to Military Health: Relevance to the health care needs of Service Members, their Families, and Veterans is a key feature of this award. Investigators are encouraged to consider the following characteristics as examples of how a project may demonstrate relevance to military health:\n• Explanation of how the project addresses an aspect of psychological health conditions and/or TBI that has direct relevance to the health and/or readiness of Service Members, their Families, and Veterans.\n• Description of how the knowledge, information, products, or technologies gained from the proposed research could be implemented in a dual-use capacity to benefit the civilian population and also address a military need.\n• Use of military or Veteran populations, samples, or datasets in the proposed research, if appropriate.\nCollaborations between researchers or consultants at military or Veterans organizations and non-military organizations are strongly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique data and research resources that the partners bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing TBI and psychological health research of significance to Service Members, their Families, and Veterans. A list of websites that may be useful in identifying additional information about ongoing DOD and VA areas of research interest or potential opportunities for collaboration can be found in\nAppendix 2.\nAwards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025.\nThe CDMRP expects to allot approximately $17.05M to fund approximately six TRA Research Level 1 applications and eight TRA Research Level 2 applications. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.', 'Link to Additional Information:': '', 'Grantor Contact Information:': 'If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:\nCDMRP Help Desk\nPhone: 301-682-5507\nEmail: help@eBRAP.org\n\nCDMRP Help Desk'}"

The award mechanism supports execution of a synergistic, multidisciplinary research program with the potential to have a significant impact on psychological health conditions and/or TBI through clinical applications, including health care products, technologies, and/or practice guidelines. Applications may propose applied/preclinical/clinical research (including clinical trials). Hypothesis-driven health services research, implementation science, and follow-up care research are also within scope for this mechanism.\nKey aspects of the FY24 TBIPHRP FPA include:\n• Overarching Challenge: FPA applications must describe a unifying, overarching challenge that will be addressed by the set of research projects proposed. The overarching challenge must be relevant to a critical problem or question in the field of research and/or patient care in at least one sub-area within one of the three FY24 TBIPHRP FPA Focus Areas.\n• Research Projects: Applications shall include multiple, distinct research projects led by individual project leaders that address complementary aspects of the overarching challenge. Applicants are required to submit three to five research projects, of which, a clinical research/trial project is strongly encouraged. While individual projects must be capable of standing on their own high scientific merits, they must also be interrelated, synergistic, and align with the overarching challenge to advance a solution beyond what would be possible through individual efforts. The exploration of multiple hypotheses or viewpoints of the same line of questioning is encouraged. This award mechanism is not intended to support a series of research projects that are dependent on the success of one of the other projects. Each project should propose a unique approach to addressing the overarching challenge and be capable of producing research findings with potential to impact the field and/or patient care. Individual research projects may include applied research, preclinical research, clinical research, and clinical trials. Proposed research projects must not include basic research.5 Preliminary data must be included to support each project’s hypothesis/objective(s). There should be a clear intent to progress toward translational/clinical work over the course of the effort.\n• Implementation: The research strategy to address the overarching challenge must be supported by a detailed implementation plan that identifies critical milestones and outlines the knowledge, resources, and technical innovations that will be utilized to achieve the milestones. A robust statistical plan and statistical expertise should be included where applicable. A plan for assessing individual project performance and progress toward addressing the overarching challenge must be included in the implementation plan. Plans to include an External Advisory Board (EAB) are encouraged; however, applicants must be careful to avoid potential conflicts of interest (COIs) during review of the application by ensuring no contact with, recruiting of, or naming of specific EAB members in the application. For multi-institutional collaborations, plans for communication and data transfer among the collaborating institutions, as well as how data, specimens, and/or products obtained during the study will be handled, must be included. An appropriate intellectual and material property plan agreed to by participating organizations is required in the application’s supporting documentation.\n• Research Team: The overall effort will be led by a Principal Investigator (PI) with demonstrated success in leading large, focused collaborative projects. The PI is required to devote a minimum of 20% effort to this award. The PI should create an environment that fosters and supports collaboration and innovation in a way that engages all members of the team in all aspects of the research plan. The research team assembled by the PI should be highly qualified and multidisciplinary, with identified project leaders for each of the complementary and synergistic research projects. The resources and expertise brought to the team by each project leader should combine to create a robust, synergistic collaboration. The TBIPHRP Science Officer assigned to a resulting award should be invited to participate in research team meetings (e.g., annual meetings of the entire research team). The plan for such meetings should be noted in the application.\n• Milestone Meeting: The PI will be required to present an update on progress toward accomplishing the goals of the award at a Milestone Meeting after the conclusion of year 2 of the period of performance. This virtual meeting will be attended by members of the TBIPHRP Programmatic Panel, CDMRP staff, the USAMRAA Grants/Contracts Officer, and other DOD stakeholders.\nClinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), diagnostics, devices, therapies, clinical guidance, behavioral interventions, emerging approaches and technologies, and/or new indications for products currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -cleared. Proposed clinical trials should demonstrate feasibility or inform the design of more advanced trials that determine efficacy in relevant patient populations. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/ Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document_DEC2022.pdf.\nResearch Scope: Applications to the FY24 TBIPHRP FPA may include preclinical applied research (including animal research), clinical research, and clinical trials/testing (or equivalent). The FY24 TBIPHRP ERA may also support ancillary studies that are associated with an ongoing or completed clinical trial and projects that optimize the design of future clinical trials. This award may not be used to support studies requiring an exception from informed consent (EFIC).\nA clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\nStudies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document.pdf.\nFor the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research.

NOAA advances scientific and technical programs to help society cope with, and adapt to, today\'s variations in climate and to prepare for tomorrow\'s. Toward this end, the agency conducts and supports climate research, observations, modeling, information management, assessments, interdisciplinary decision support research, outreach, education, and stakeholder partnership development. These investments are key to NOAA\'s mission of ""Science, Service, and Stewardship"" and are guided by the agency\'s vision to create and sustain enhanced resilience in ecosystems, communities, and economies, as described in NOAA\'s Next Generation Strategic Plan (NGSP) . Fostering climate adaptation and mitigation, and, specifically, the development of an informed society anticipating and responding to climate and its impacts - is one of the primary pathways through which NOAA plans to advance its mission. The NGSP outlines NOAA\'s five-year climate objectives: 1) Improved scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its impacts; 2) Assessments of current and future states of the climate system that identify potential impacts and inform science, service, and stewardship decisions; 3) Mitigation and adaptation choices supported by sustained, reliable, and timely climate services; and 4) A climate-literate public that understands its vulnerabilities to a changing climate and makes informed decisions. NOAA works in partnership with Federal, academic, private, and international research entities, and places a substantial emphasis on productive partnerships and interactions with decision makers and other stakeholders.Within this context, NOAA\'s Climate Program Office (CPO) manages competitive research programs conducted in regions across the United States, at national and international scales, and globally. The CPO also provides strategic guidance and oversight for the agency\'s climate science and services programs and helps to integrate capabilities from across the agency to provide enhanced services to its constituents. Achieving the first of the NGSP climate objectives, an improved scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its impacts, requires a number of core capabilities be supported. These core capabilities can be broadly categorized to include: (a) understanding and modeling, (b) observing systems, data stewardship, and climate monitoring, (c) predictions and projections, and (d) integrated service development and decision support.These core capabilities, in turn, will focus initially on the following societal challenges identified in the NGSP as early evidence of progress to be made by NOAA in providing sustained, reliable, and timely climate services:* Climate Impacts on Water Resources* Coasts and Climate Resilience* Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems* Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate* Information for Mitigating Climate ChangeEach of the Competitions announced in this Federal Funding Opportunity addresses one or more of these core capabilities or societal challenges. It is expected that applications submitted in response to this Opportunity will identify their relevance to NOAA\'s climate science and services by indicating which core capabilities and/or societal challenges will be addressed by the proposed work. Application abstracts must include a paragraph describing the work\'s relevance to the NGSP\'s long-term goal of climate adaptation and mitigation as well as to the Competition that is being targeted.In FY 2012, we estimate that $15.5 million will be available for approximately 60 new awards pending budget appropriations. It is anticipated that most awards will be at a funding level between $50,000 and $200,000 per year, with some exceptions for larger awards.
