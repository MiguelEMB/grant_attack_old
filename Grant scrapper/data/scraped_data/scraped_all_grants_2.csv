  -
NSF sponsored Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) may submit proposals provided that they do not include costs for which federal funds have already been awarded or are expected to be awarded.


*Who May Serve as PI:

The PI and any Co-PIs must hold an appointment at an organization that is eligible to submit as described under ""Who May Submit Proposals."" At least one PI or Co-PI from a Phase-1 award must be included as a PI or Co-PI on the Phase-2 proposal that is based on that Phase-1 award. The same individual who served as PI for the Phase-1 award does not have to be PI for the Phase-2 proposal, however any change of PI and Co-PI should be fully explained in the Phase-2 proposal. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The Regional Resilience Innovation Incubators (R2I2) is a cross-directorate NSF solicitation led by the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) and the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP). R2I2 will support community- engaged team science to co-design high-impact solutions to climate-related societal challenges that leverage recent advances in fundamental climate change and Earth system science research. Each R2I2 project will address specific regional climate challenges and will develop and demonstrate solutions to those challenges that can be effectively applied in real- world settings. Investment in R2I2 will leverage past federal investments in addressing climate change and will provide a bridge connecting advancements in basic science with local knowledge, informed decision making, and technological innovations for societal applications.


R2I2 will be implemented in two phases, concept creation and implementation. This solicitation, focused on Phase-1, will fund a series of pilot projects focusing on project concept creation and refinement for solutions specific to a U.S. climate region.


Targeted areas for establishing R2I2 incubators will be based on ten climate regions defined by the Fifth National Climate Assessment (Table 1.1): Northeast, Southeast, U.S. Caribbean, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, Northwest, Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaii & U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands. Although geographic diversity will be a factor considered when determining the portfolio of awards, the review process may result in funding multiple projects in one climate region and none in others. Individual R2I2 projects may propose solutions that apply to more than one climate region defined above. This solicitation will also fund an award for the creation of a R2I2 National Office (RNO) to support the collective and coordinated implementation of R2I2 award activities. NSF envisions the release of a separate solicitation for Phase-2 implementation projects in fiscal year 2026, subject to the availability of funds. Only Phase-1 award recipients will be eligible to submit Phase-2 proposals. Phase-2 awards will be selected based on a merit review of Phase-2 proposals and performance during Phase-1.

<ul>
<li>Proposers that have submitted aSBIR/STTR Fast-Track Project Pitch and received an official invitation from a cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Program Officerwithinthe 4 months precedingthe proposal submission date. To start this process, proposers must first create a log in and submit a Project Pitch document via the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Project Pitch<a href=""https://seedfund.nsf.gov/project-pitch/"">online form</a>. The cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Program Officer will use the Project Pitch to determine whether the proposed project is a good fit for the Fast-Track program.</li>
<li>Companies qualifying as a small business concern are eligible to participate in the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs (see<a href=""https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/elig_size_compliance_guide.pdf"">Guide to SBIR/STTR Program Eligibility</a>for more information). Please note that the size limit of 500 employees includes affiliates.

For STTR proposals, the proposing small business must also include a partner research institution in the project, see additional details below.</li>
<li>The SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot effort shares the same goals as the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I and Phase II funding opportunities, but the Fast-Track pilot programs have different eligibility requirements. Small businesses applying to the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs must have 1) a lineage of NSF research funding, 2) at least one Senior/Key Personnel to have undergone formal customer discovery training, and 3) the entire team must already be in place (not yet to be determined) at the time of proposal submission. If the small business concern does not meet all three of these criteria, their proposal will be transferred to the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I program for consideration.
<ul>
<li>Lineage Eligibility Requirement.The technical innovation in the Fast-Track proposal must be derived from a prior NSF research award that is either currently active or was active within the previous five years from the date of submission of the Fast-Track proposal. The Fast-Track Project Pitch and proposal must include the NSF award number and title of the research award that is relied upon to meet the lineage requirement. The Fast-Track proposal&rsquo;s PI or at least one Senior/Key Personnel must have been supported under the lineage award. If the Fast-Track team member relied upon to meet the lineage requirement is named on the lineage award, no further documentation will berequired. If not, the Fast-Track proposal must include a letter from the PI or a Co-PI of the lineage award confirming that either the PI or a named Senior/Key Personnel on the Fast-Track team was engaged in research undertaken under the lineage award.In addition to regular NSF research awards (e.g., CAREER, individual investigator awards, center/institute awards, etc.),<a href=""https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/pfi"">Partnerships for Innovation (PFI)</a>and<a href=""https://www.nsfgrfp.org/"">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)</a>awards<span>do</span>count as NSF lineage forSBIR/STTR Fast-Track eligibility.<a href=""https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/i-corps/about-teams"">NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps)</a>and<a href=""https://seedfund.nsf.gov/"">NSF SBIR/STTR</a>awards<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">do not</span>count as NSF research lineage and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">do not</span> convey SBIR/STTR Fast-Track eligibility.</li>
<li>Formal Customer Discovery Eligibility Requirement.Companies must have received formal customer discovery training, defined as follows, within the Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The NSF SBIR/STTR and SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support moving scientific excellence and technological innovation from the lab to the market. By funding startups and small businesses, NSF helps build a strong national economy and stimulates the creation of novel products, services, and solutions in private, public, or government sectors with potential for broad impact; strengthens the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increases the commercial application of federally supported research results; and develops and increases the US workforce, especially by fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses.


These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs provide fixed amount cooperative agreements for thedevelopment of a broad range of technologiesbased on discoveries in science and engineeringwith potential for societal and economic impacts. Unlike fundamental or basic research activities that focus on scientific and engineering discovery itself, the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support the creation of opportunities to move use-inspired and translational discoveries out of the lab and into the market or other use at scale, through startups and small businesses.The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs do not solicit specific technologies or procure goods and services from startups and small businesses.Any invention conceivedorreduced to practice with the assistance ofSBIR/STTR fundingis subject to the Bayh-Dole Act. For more information refer to SBIR/STTR Frequently Asked Questions #75 . 


NSF promotes inclusion by encouraging proposals from diverse populations and geographic locations.


The traditional NSF SBIR/STTR programs include two funding Phases – Phase I and Phase II. All proposers to the programs must first apply for Phase I funding – there is no direct-to-Phase II option. Under a traditional NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I award, a small business can receive non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&D) to demonstrate technical feasibility over 6 to 12 months and then, after completion of a Phase I project, companies may apply for Phase II funding to further develop the proposed technology.


There aresignificantbenefits for SBIR/STTRFast-Track recipients:the submission of only oneproposalfor Phase I and Phase IIand a faster transition from Phase I to Phase II.While startups and small businesses face many challenges, NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track funding is intended to specifically focus on challenges associated with technological innovation; that is, on the creation of new products, services, and other scalable solutions based on fundamental science or engineering. A successful Fast-Track proposal must demonstrate how NSF funding will help the small business create a proof-of-concept or prototype by retiring technical risk.


NSF seeks unproven, leading-edge, technology innovations that demonstrate the following characteristics: The innovations are underpinned and enabled by a new scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation. The innovations still require intensive technical research and development to be fully embedded in a reliable product or service. The innovations have not yet been reduced to practice by anyone and it is not guaranteed, at present, that doing so is technically possible. The innovations provide a strong competitive advantage that are not easily replicable by competitors (even technically proficient ones). Once reduced to practice, the innovations are expected to result in a product or service that would either be disruptive to existing markets or create new markets/new market segments. The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and start-ups by translating new scientific and engineering concepts into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. The programs provide non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&D) of use-inspired scientific and engineering activities at the earliest stages of the company and technology development. During the course of the award, the emphasis is expected to shift from de-risking those aspects preventing the innovation from reaching technical feasibility and driving the intended impact to a greater focus on commercially relevant development activities that will allow the company to differentiate itself and drive new value propositions to the market and society.


NSF encourages input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities.


These NSF programs are governed by 15 USC 638 and the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended ( 42 USC §1861, et seq. ).


Introduction to the Program


The NSF SBIR/STTR programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and startups by translating new scientific and engineering discoveries emerging from the private sector, federal labs, and academia into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits.


These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs enable companies based on previous NSF awards (NSF award lineage) to submita single proposalthat, if awarded, can provide a faster pathway from Phase I to Phase II funding.Receipt of full funding under the Fast-Track pilot programs is contingent on the results of a company’s Phase II transition review.


The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs are part of the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP) , which was recently launched to accelerate innovation and enhance economic competitiveness by catalyzing partnerships and investments that strengthen the links between fundamental research and technology development, deployment, and use.

The startup&rsquo;s or small business&rsquo; research and development (R&amp;D) must be performed within the United Sta Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The NSF SBIR/STTRprograms provide non-dilutive funds for use-inspired research and development (R&D) of unproven, leading-edge, technology innovations that address societal challenges. By investing federal research and development funds into startups and small businesses, NSF helps build a strong national economy and stimulates the creation of novel products, services, and solutions in the private sector; strengthens the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increases the commercial application of federally-supported research results; and develops and increases the U.S. workforce, especially by fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically-disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses.


NSF seeks unproven, leading-edge technology innovations that demonstrate the following characteristics: The innovations are underpinned and enabled by a new scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation. The innovations still require intensive technical research and development to be fully embedded in a reliable product or service. The innovations have not yet been reduced to practice by anyone and it is not guaranteed, at present, that doing so is technically possible. The innovations provide a strong competitive advantage that are not easily replicable by competitors (even technically proficient ones). Once reduced to practice, the innovations are expected to result in a product or service that would either be disruptive to existing markets or create new markets/new market segments. The NSF SBIR/STTR programs fund broadly across scientific and engineering disciplines and do not solicit specific technologies or procure goods and services from startups and small businesses. The funding provided is non-dilutive. Any invention conceived or reduced to practice with the assistance of SBIR/STTR funding is subject to the Bayh-Dole Act. For more information, refer to the SBIR/STTR Frequently Asked Questions, #75 .


NSF encourages input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities.


This program is governed by 15 U.S.C. 638 and the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended ( 42 U.S.C. 1861 et seq. ).


Introduction to Program:


The SBIR and STTR programs, initiated at NSF, were established in 1982 as part of the Small Business Innovation Development Act. The NSF SBIR/STTR programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and startups by translating new scientific and engineering discoveries emerging from the private sector, federal labs, and academia into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits.


The NSF SBIR/STTR programs are now part of the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP) , which was recently launched to accelerate innovation and enhance economic competitiveness by catalyzing partnerships and investments that strengthen the links between fundamental research and technology development, deployment, and use.

Tajikistan organizations should submit a copy of their certificate of registration from the appropriate government organization. Additional Information Agency Name: U.S. Mission to Tajikistan Description: Purpose of Public Diplomacy Grants: PDS Embassy Dushanbe invites proposals for programs that strengthen ties between the United States and Tajikistan in priority program areas (see below) in order to highlight shared values and promote bilateral cooperation. All proposed programs must include an American element, either through a connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institutions/s, usage of American educational/informational resources, or any other activities that promote or contribute to increased mutual understanding between the people of the United States and people of Tajikistan. Competitive proposals will promote continued and sustainable cooperation between the people of the United States and Tajikistan even after the project concludes. Competitive proposals will include partnership with Tajik governmental bodies, and to organizations that have a demonstrated track record of implementing such programs. Examples of programs could include, but are not limited to: ·        Academic or professional exchanges, lectures, seminars, trainings, speaker programs, or workshops; and ·        Artistic, cultural, or sports workshops, masterclasses, joint performances, and/or exhibitions. PDS welcomes proposals that support one of the following priority program areas: TOPIC 1: Counter Gender-based Violence (GBV) Domestic violence (DV) and gender-based violence (GBV) remains a serious issue in Tajikistan—and much of the world. In a USAID-funded survey in Tajikistan, 97% of men and 60% of women believed spousal abuse was justified. Cases of GBV and DV are underreported because victims wish to avoid humiliation, reprisal, or social stigmatization, or believe it may have been warranted. Further, authorities wishing to promote traditional gender roles frequently dismiss domestic violence as a “family matter” or only gave a warning or fine. Government resources for survivors are also limited. Project Audience(s) may include: ·        Religiously or socially conservative communities, especially Tajik men (18-50 years old) ·        High school students (14-18 years old.) ·        Youth and emerging leaders (18-35 years old.) ·        University teachers and students. ·        Labor migrants and spouses of labor migrants. ·        Tajik advocacy groups. ·        Government bodies. ·        Independent media including bloggers and vloggers Countering Gender-Based Violence Project Goal: Empower civil society and communities in Tajikistan to prevent and prosecute cases of Domestic Violence (DV) or Gender-Based Violence (GBV) through community-led initiatives. Project Objectives (may address one or more of the following): ·        Messaging campaigns or awareness raising activities, such as sports diplomacy, should engage and target both men and women. Having men as the face of campaigns, or having men speak to men standing against GBV, demonstrates solidarity and emphasizes that eradicating gender-based violence is the collective responsibility of everyone, regardless of gender. ·        Improve collaboration between civil society, independent media, and the government to identify and address gaps in existing laws and policies that criminalize GBV/DV, provide protections for victims, and establish legal frameworks for persecution. ·         Raise awareness among vulnerable populations about laws, rights, and support services concerning early marriage, domestic abuse, harassment, divorce, alimony, and other civil rights. TOPIC 2: Promoting Women’s Economic Empowerment and Entrepreneurship Due to the high rate of male labor migration and unemployment, more Tajik women are exploring ways to financially support their households and communities. However, women entrepreneurs' activities are highly dependent on the effectiveness of the business environment in the country. Moreover, the mountainous regions throughout the country challenge the development of entrepreneurship, as does lack of information, limited access to financing for starting a business, and other socio-economic conditions. Nevertheless, successful small business development creates new employment opportunities in Tajikistan and helps women support themselves and their families. Small businesses are fast becoming the main source of income for women in Tajikistan. Proposed projects should enhance women’s participation, promotion, and longevity in the Tajik economy and ability to assume leadership positions. Projects should clearly support the protection of economic rights for women and increase respect for women’s rights in society to improve their independence and proactive role in Tajik society. Project Audience(s) may include: · Women from r ural areas (including the spouses of labor migrants) and women entrepreneurs. ·        Small businesses in rural areas. ·        Business associations. ·        Financial and government institutions. ·        Tourism agencies (including guesthouse and small hotels). ·        Community leaders and youth demonstrating leadership potential in these areas. Women’s Economic Empowerment Project Goal: Increase the capacity of women from underserved, rural communities, including the spouses of labor migrants, to participate or increase their participation in the Tajik economy. Improve women's economic opportunities in Tajikistan by increasing the capacity of women to start, establish, or expand their own companies. Project Objectives (may address one or more of the following): ·        Develop the business and technical skills of women in rural communities to increase employability, launch and/or improve their own businesses. ·        Establish and conduct activities with a professional network for women from under-represented communities, including the spouses of labor migrants, to support mentorship relationships and collaborative initiatives among network members that go beyond the conclusion of project activities. o  Projects could connect women’s entrepreneurship in the development of tourism around newly recognized UNESCO heritage sites. o  Increase awareness of tourism initiatives and employment opportunities centered around newly designated UNESCO heritage sites. o  Projects could seek to increase participation of women from underserved and target communities in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). ·        Increase women’s knowledge and understanding about their legal rights in society and how to advocate for the respect of those rights. o  Increase women’s knowledge and understanding about their legal rights in the workplace, including rights related to employment, equal pay, job security, and access to economic opportunities. o  Equip Tajik women with the ability to advocate for the recognition and enforcement of these rights. ·        Promote women’s economic empowerment and entrepreneurship through support from start-up hubs, corporate social responsibility, and/or access to finance. Emphasis should be placed on strengthening chambers of commerce, entrepreneurs, and core private sector industries through interactions or linkages with U.S. counterparts. o  Facilitate access to funding resources and financing opportunities for women entrepreneurs to launch and grow their businesses. o  Strengthen organizational capacities of chambers of commerce to support business development of aspiring female entrepreneurs. o  Facilitate interactions and linkages between women entrepreneurs, chambers of commerce, startup hubs, and private sector industries in Tajikistan and their U.S. counterparts. TOPIC 3: Sharing America with Tajikistan The United States values innovation, creativity, critical thinking, freedom of expression, democratic principles, economic growth, and security. The United States supports a sovereign and independent Tajikistan, which includes support for a well-informed, discerning public who can inoculate itself against disinformation. Both the United States and Tajikistan have rich cultural traditions as shown in literature and storytelling, theater and performing arts, film, music, dance, sport, and education. Educational, cultural, and other exchange activities are a great way to engage the public, especially at-risk youth and those with neutral views or misconceptions about the United States, in order to bridge our cultures, deepen understanding, and discuss topics of mutual importance. Proposed projects should strengthen understanding between the United States and Tajikistan and advance areas of mutual interest by leveraging the experiences and lessons learned from the United States, while respecting cultural differences.

The mission of the LQC can be captured in three broad goals: 1) pursue disruptive fundamental research and enabling technologies with a focus on qubit development for quantum computing and other applications (such as sensing); 2) grow deep, collaborative partnerships to tackle the most difficult and relevant long-term problems in quantum information science and technology; and 3) build a quantum workforce of tomorrow through research experiences in government at LPS and at LQC partners. The LQC will offer a mechanism for collaborative research between LPS and academia, industry, FFRDCs, and Government Laboratories to advance foundational and transformative research on challenging problems that have hindered progress in quantum information processing and associated technologies. The goal of this BAA is to seek proposals that bring together expertise from the public and private sectors and their respective research infrastructures to advance solutions that may be best approached as a collaborative team. A Collaboratory is “a center without walls, in which the nation’s researchers can perform their research without regard to physical location, interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, [and] accessing information in digital libraries. This BAA introduces LQC Research Thrusts ( A.1.1 ) which are the technical areas of interest—which will be updated periodically—where partners of the LQC will pursue joint research with LPS through Incubator ( A.1.2 ) and Collaboration ( A.1.3 ) collaborative agreements. The LQC BAA also fulfills the Government’s overarching interest--through the proposed research and on-site research experiences--in creating and training a workforce in quantum science and technology, generating pathways of solutions that feed technology development, establishing partnerships, and creating transition opportunities. In further support of training through research, Section A.1.4 calls for Quantum Computing Research (QuaCR) Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships for US citizens working in areas of interest. Substantial progress on solving the most difficult and long-term Quantum Information Science & Technology (QIST) research problems that unleash further rapid progress in the field will constitute LQC success. Examples of such research problems include (but are not limited to): limits of performance due to device design, material selection, and/or control, the exploration of alternative qubit physics (e.g., different approaches to qubit encoding or types of gates) and lowering of barriers to such approaches, advances in materials that improve qubit gate fidelity, reducing the overhead of classical components in quantum information technology and optimizing classical performance, and the exploration of applications of quantum technologies to new domains. Three categories of proposals are sought for this BAA: 1.Incubator opportunities seek partnership proposals from single investigators and small research groups, including teaching colleges, who may have unique skillsets to contribute toward the pursuit of the research thrusts presented in A.1.1. Incubator proposals may also be the development of concepts into a detailed technical research approach to advance solution of problems of high interest to quantum information science research. Incubator proposals would avail themselves of the collaboration opportunities with LPS research staff and infrastructure made available at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) to lay the groundwork for concepts that may be suitable for a Collaboratory proposal or responses to other DoD quantum information science research opportunities. 2.Collaboratory proposals seek research proposals that bring together a strong significant collaboration--researchers from academia, industry, FFRDCs, and/or Government Laboratories--to pursue long-term projects focused on fundamental problems of interest to qubit development and/or associated science and technology. These collaborative groups will propose to work together in a focused manner for a period of time expected to be one to three years in order to demonstrate a proof-of-concept experiment and/or theory exploration to determine the feasibility of their creative idea. 3.QuaCR Research Fellowship proposals seek to support talented U.S. citizen graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the field of quantum information processing (primary interest) and quantum sensing (secondary interest). Applicants with a background from either within or outside QIS are encouraged. The proposed research areas are described in this BAA and must enhance active Quantum Information Science research efforts being supported by the Army Research Office and/or LPS. Research fellows are encouraged to complete an LPS Internship during their graduate career or visit during their postdoctoral fellowship Link to Additional Information: ARO & ARL BAA SITE Grantor Contact Information: If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact: Technical Program Point of Contact (ARO): Dr. T.R.

Additional Information Agency Name: National Telecommunications and Information Admini Description: This Notice of Funding Opportunity solicits applications for the Digital Equity Competitive Grant Program (“Competitive Grant Program” or “Program”), the third of three digital equity programs authorized by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Division F, Title III, Public Law 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, 1209 (November 15, 2021) (“Infrastructure Act,” also known as the “Digital Equity Act” or “DE Act”).

The Competitive Grant Program will support efforts to achieve digital equity, promote digital inclusion activities, and spur greater adoption and meaningful use of broadband among the Covered Populations. Specifically, the Digital Equity Act authorizes funds to be used for the development and implementation of digital inclusion activities that benefit the Covered Populations; programs that facilitate the adoption of broadband by Covered Populations to provide educational and employment opportunities; training programs that cover basic, advanced, and applied skills; workforce development programs; access to equipment, instrumentation, networking capability, hardware and software, or digital network technology for broadband services at low or no cost; and the construction or operation of public access computing centers for Covered Populations.

The terms “State” and “State agency” are used as defined in section 3 of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1532). Currently, eligible State agencies are listed here: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/endangered-speciesconservation/endangered-species-act-section-6-program-cooperation. Any State agency that enters into a section 6(c) agreement with NMFS within 30 days of the grant application deadline is also eligible to apply. Federal agencies or institutions are not eligible to receive Federal assistance under this notice. In addition, no Federal employee (or agency) shall provide assistance by writing or editing any part of an application, write letters of support advocating for any application, or otherwise confer any unfair advantage on a particular application. However, proposed activities can involve collaboration with current NMFS programs or NMFS employees, and NMFS employees can submit letters verifying that they would collaborate on a particular project if funded. Applicants must contact the Species Recovery Grants Federal Program Officer listed in Section VII, Agency Contacts, prior to submission for guidance if collaborating with a NMFS program or NMFS employee. The level of collaboration may dictate whether the funding is awarded through a grant or cooperative agreement. Additional Information Agency Name: DOC NOAA - ERA Production Description: States play an essential role in conserving and recovering species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1535. Listed species under NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) jurisdiction may spend all or part of their life cycles in state waters, and success in conserving these species depends largely on working cooperatively with the States. NMFS is authorized to provide Federal assistance to eligible State agencies to support the development and implementation of conservation programs for listed marine and anadromous species that reside within that State. This assistance, provided in the form of grants or cooperative agreements through the Species Recovery Grants to States Program, can be used to support conservation activities for any endangered or threatened species, as well as monitoring of candidate species, recently delisted species, and species proposed for listing under the ESA. Proposals that address the recovery of the following endangered species are encouraged as part of the agency’s Species in the Spotlight initiative: Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) Gulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment (DPS), Cook Inlet DPS of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), Hawaiian monk seals (Neomonachus schauinslandi), North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), Pacific leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), Rice’s whale (Balaenoptera ricei), southern resident DPS of killer whales (Orcinus orca), and white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni). Funded activities may include development and implementation of management efforts, scientific research, and public education and outreach. Any State agency that has entered into an agreement with NMFS pursuant to section 6(c) of the ESA or enters into such an agreement within 30 days of the application deadline is eligible to apply under this solicitation. Proposals focusing on Pacific salmonids will not be considered for funding under this grant program; such projects may be considered through the NMFS Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. Additionally, proposals focusing on sea turtle stranding response and/or rehabilitation will not be considered for funding under this grant program; such projects may be considered and funded by NOAA through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Sea Turtles Program. This document describes how to submit proposals for funding in fiscal year (FY) 2025 and how NMFS will evaluate and select proposals for funding. This document should be read in its entirety; some information has changed from the previous year.

To be eligible to apply or receive an award, applicant organizations must complete and maintain three registrations; SAM.gov, Grants.gov, and eRA Commons. For each, the complete registration process can take 4 to 6 weeks, so applicants must begin this activity as soon as possible and well before the proposal due date. For more information on how to meet these registration and application submission requirements without errors, we advise all to carefully review relevant Applicant and Grantee Training modules: https://www.commerce.gov/ocio/programs/gems/applicant-and-grantee-training. Additionally, we advise that all carefully read ‘Additional Application Package Forms’ within the ‘Full Proposal Required Elements’ section below.

The National Sea Grant College Program champions diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) by recruiting, retaining and preparing a diverse workforce, and proactively engaging and serving the diverse populations of coastal communities. Sea Grant is committed to building inclusive research, extension, communication and education programs that serve people with unique backgrounds, circumstances, needs, perspectives and ways of thinking. We encourage applicants of all ages, races, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, disabilities, cultures, religions, citizenship types, marital statuses, education levels, job classifications, veteran status types, income, and socioeconomic status types to apply for this opportunity. Additional Information Agency Name: DOC NOAA - ERA Production Description: The National Sea Grant College Program was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1966 (amended in 2020, Public Law 116-221) to support leveraged federal and state partnerships that harness the intellectual capacity of the nation’s universities and research institutions to solve problems and generate opportunities in coastal communities. The National Sea Grant Office (NSGO) supports the development of Sea Grant projects and programs in the remaining geographic areas that are eligible for Sea Grant College Program designation in accordance with the National Sea Grant College Program Act, as amended in 2020 (Sea Grant Act) (33 U.S.C. 1121 et seq.) and the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (15 CFR 917 and 15 CFR 918), which set forth the eligibility, qualifications, and responsibilities for Sea Grant programs. Approximately $2,400,000 of federal funds may be available, pending future federal appropriations, to support two awards in order to develop a new Sea Grant project in each of the following geographic areas: U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI). Awards will be made for no more than $1,200,000 in federal funds per four year project, not to exceed $300,000/year. There is a required 50% non-federal match for all Sea Grant federal funding. Waivers to non-federal match will be considered during the federal financial assistance application process, where applicable. Applications to this opportunity should propose projects that: have a topical focus relevant to the national focus areas outlined in the National Sea Grant College Program Strategic Plan , be executed through one or more of the Sea Grant functional areas of research, extension, or education, as defined in the Strategic Plan and explore capabilities and needs in the proposed geographic area. All projects must take place within the United States or territories or their respective waterways. Applicant organizations must complete and maintain three registrations to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. These registrations include SAM.gov , Grants.gov, and eRA Commons . All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. The complete registration process for all three systems can take 4 to 6 weeks, so applicants should begin this activity as soon as possible. If an eligible applicant does not have access to the internet, please contact the Agency Contacts listed in Section VII for submission instructions. Prior to registering with eRA Commons, applicant organizations must first obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) from SAM.gov, if needed (refer to Section IV. Applications and Submission Information, Section C). Organizations can register with eRA Commons in tandem with completing their full SAM and Grants.gov registrations; however, all registrations must be in place by time of application submission. eRA Commons requires organizations to identify at least one Signing Official (SO) and at least one Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) account in order to submit an application.

These grants focus on building capacity in the research field by: 1) addressing questions relevant to child care policy decision-making and program administration, and 2) fostering mentoring relationships between faculty members and doctoral students. OPRE is interested in research that addresses issues of significance related to CCDF; aims to inform policy decisions and solutions, particularly for populations that are underserved/understudied; and utilizes the most rigorous research methodology for the selected research question. Applicants must consult with a CCDF agency or administrator in the conceptualization of the research plan, from development and refinement of the research questions, through the proposed data collection or secondary analyses of data, interpretation, and dissemination of findings. Eligible Tribally Controlled Land Grant Colleges and Universities, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and faith-based institutions of higher education are encouraged to apply. The applicant organization must have a history of research and federal funding oversight and must have appropriate research support resources to support the student. The faculty mentor who will serve as principal investigator must have a Ph.D. or equivalent in the respective field and conduct research as a primary professional responsibility. Faculty mentors with doctoral training and research expertise must be able to provide proper supervision and quality control over the project and interactions with participating agencies to help ensure successful completion of sound dissertation research that addresses critical policy questions of interest to local CCDF partner(s) and ACF. The graduate student must provide evidence of an approved dissertation proposal. This is a change from previous years when applicants were given additional time to submit evidence of an approved dissertation proposal after the application due date. The 2025 application due date and the due date for the evidence of an approved proposal will be specified in the Notice of Funding Opportunity.

Additional Information Agency Name: Veterans Employment and Training Service Description: The U.S. Department of Labor’s (DOL) Veterans’ Employment and Training Service (VETS) supports local Stand Down events that assist veterans experiencing homelessness by providing a wide range of employment, social, and health services. Stand Down is a military term referring to an opportunity to achieve a brief respite from combat. Troops assemble in a base camp to receive new clothing, hot food, support services, and a relative degree of safety before returning to combat action. A DOL VETS-funded Stand Down event serves a similar purpose; however, it is intended for veterans experiencing or at-risk of homelessness. The critical services provided at these events are often the catalyst that enables those individuals to reenter the workforce. VETS awards these noncompetitive grants on a first-come, first-served basis to support one-day or multi-day events at up to $7,000 or $10,000, respectively. They are collaborative events coordinated between VA, DOL, other federal, state, and local government agencies and community-based organizations providing services and supplies to veterans experiencing and at risk of homelessness. In the event of a federal disaster declaration, VETS will accept applications up to $50,000 to conduct Stand Down events in the impacted areas. State, Territory, and Possession, county, city, local, special district, and Native American tribal governments and agencies, non-profit and for-profit entities, state and local workforce boards, institutions of higher education, public and tribal housing authorities and faith-based organizations are eligible to apply.

Please carefully follow all instructions outlined below in this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO). Purpose of Grant: Every means of access to information for Venezuelans has been in decline since 2018. Current efforts by bad actors that employ intimidation and violence to stifle independent media voices, along with a highly active disinformation machine, has resulted in a “media information desert” of more than five million Venezuelans with limited options to access accurate information. VAU PAS invites proposals to fund projects that will infiltrate that desert with access to accurate information — projects that support the strengthening of the Venezuelan independent press, use accessible technologies to ensure the free flow of non-biased information, and execute on innovative ways to inform, and keep informed, Venezuelan citizens while maintaining their security under an oppressive environment. Grant projects take any number of forms, including leveraging technological innovations, analog information campaigns, workshops, courses, trainings, public debates, guerilla media, virtual camps, conferences, creative public interventions, think tanks, online projects, or other activities. For example, a successful project could implement an encrypted and safe new way to create a network and distribute accurate information to journalists and influencers. Another project could identify, train, and provide mobile equipment for citizen journalists to effectively report on what is happening in their communities while maintaining their safety and security. Yet another project could create a mentorship program for the newest generation of journalists that lack the guidance of veterans forced out of Venezuela. A final example could be a project connecting experts with student journalists who will soon have to tackle the problems of Venezuela today. The best proposals will have significant activities focused on reaching audiences inside Venezuela with news and independently-vetted information, but that does not preclude applicants from considering putting together regionally-focused proposals that include participants or partners from neighboring nations. Note: In light of social distancing measures, and to limit the spread of COVID-19, we welcome creative proposals that navigate the health and security concerns. Program Themes : VAU is seeking applications that focus on the following themes: REACHING AUDIENCES WHERE THEY ARE: Be that on digital or traditional media, in a gas station queue, on tshirts or television, or via graffiti on a wall, projects should recognize where audiences are and how they might be able – at no cost to them- to consume and distribute information, then propose ways to effectively message in that space. JOURNALISM TRAINING & EDUCATION : Projects might aim to: increase the professional skills of professional journalists; strengthen the investigative journalism skills of media professionals; train journalists on new techniques and approaches to make the transition to digital journalism; strengthen university programs for journalism students; organize virtual summer camps for aspiring young journalists; teach individuals how to become citizen journalists; offer mentorship programs for the newest generation; and/or promote regional collaboration among professional journalists and journalism students. MANAGING NEWS OUTLETS AND FINANCING : Projects might aim to: strengthen the ability of owners and managers to operate their independent news outlets and deal with the challenges they face in the 21st century media space. A component could include ways to monetize or create revenue at a time when Venezuela is in economic crisis. EXPANDING PUBLIC DEBATE : Projects might aim to: increase and deepen reporting on community issues and public policy questions at the local, regional, or national levels; increase reporting, including production of content, on role of U.S. assistance to Venezuela and importance of expanded economic, political, and cultural ties between Venezuela and its neighbors; and/or support reporting projects that examine the evolution of bilateral ties between the U.S. and Venezuela. COUNTERING DISINFORMATION : Projects might aim to: educate students, journalists, and other media consumers how to recognize, respond to, and combat disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda in the news and on the internet MEDIA FREEDOM / ROLE OF THE FREE PRESS IN A DEMOCRACY : Projects might aim to: build up understanding within Venezuelan society of the importance of freedom of the press, a prerequisite for a future free and democratic Venezuela, a key value shared by Venezuela and the United States.

Additional Information Agency Name: U.S. Mission to Cape Verde Description: U.S. Embassy Praia welcomes the submission of project applications for funding through the Ambassador’s Special Self-Help Program (SSH). If interested, please carefully review the instructions below. The SSH is a grass-roots grant assistance program that allows U.S. Ambassadors to support local requests for small community-based development projects. The purpose of the Special Self-Help Program is to support communities through modest grants that will positively impact local communities. The SSH philosophy is to help communities help themselves. Projects submitted for SSH must align with one or more U.S. Embassy priorities: Economic diversification, including small business creation and income generation Projects must aim to 1) generate sustainable income and employment opportunities in local communities, 2) advance economic diversification and encourage use of local natural resources or income generation, 3) promote a culture of entrepreneurship, and/or 4) improve economic or living conditions of a community. Women start-ups and women entrepreneurs Eligible projects assist women who are launching a business or who are overseeing the early stages of business development (between one to two years). Such projects must promote a culture of women-led entrepreneurship and innovation that can be replicated in the community. Projects must also promote profitable businesses that generate revenue and benefit the community. Social and economic inclusion and creation of opportunities Projects in this category must assist youth, children, women (particularly female heads of household), and other vulnerable groups to gain access to basic services (for example water, sanitation, and primary/pre-K education). They can also assist the creation of opportunities for vulnerable groups, particularly employment for youth. Environmental protection, sustainability, resilience to environmental vulnerabilities, and adaptation to environmental change Eligible projects will increase the capacity of communities to cope with vulnerability to drought and other environmental changes by building resilience, increasing capacity to adapt, and promoting income-generating activities. For example, projects may involve activities to improve water management, diversify agricultural practices, or provide benefits to the environment. Local Community Involvement: Local involvement of the organization or group must be at least 10% in cash or in kind of the total project costs. The community contribution of funding may be crucial to make a choice between two viable requestors. In-kind contributions could be: labor (wages of masons and workers), food, accommodation for qualified labor, carts of sand or gravel, bricks for construction, sand, fence, water supply, transportation costs, donations of materials etc. Additionally, community leaders can sign a statement of interest. Community leaders include local municipal leaders, religious leaders, civil society leaders, or any governing body that has oversight over where the project will be implemented. One community leader can sign the statement of interest; however, multiple signatures are strongly encouraged. Community leaders may also submit letters of support for the project. Elements of a Successful Project The project is initiated by the community. The project plan contains pre-established long-term goals and a coherent plan to keep the project running in the future. A capable project manager who is a long-term resident in the community is responsible for the project. There is strong coordination and communication among the grant recipient, local leaders, and local government representatives. The project makes use of materials and supplies that can be maintained by the community, and the materials that will not harm the environment. The project has a high beneficiary to budget ratio, benefiting a significant number of community members The project budget is clear, complete, and well defined. The project responds to a community need and is based on a well-developed proposal that is responsive to the priorities and criteria explained in this NOFO. Project activities and results show long-term sustainability. Application Documents and Procedures 1. Applications for Special Self-Help Funds should include the following: a.

See FOA for full eligibility details. Additional Information Agency Name: National Institutes of Health Description: This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications for P30 Cancer Center Support Grants (CCSGs) to support NCI-designated Cancer Centers. CCSGs support two types of cancer centers: 1) Comprehensive Cancer Centers, which demonstrate reasonable depth and breadth of research activities in each of three major areas: basic laboratory; clinical; and prevention, control and population-based research, and which have substantial transdisciplinary research that bridges these scientific areas; and 2) Cancer Centers, which are primarily focused on basic laboratory; clinical; and prevention, cancer control, and population-based research; or some combination of these areas. The purpose of both types of NCI-designated Cancer Centers is to capitalize on all institutional cancer research capabilities, integrating meritorious programs in laboratory, clinical, and population research into a single transdisciplinary research enterprise across all institutional boundaries. Cancer Centers supported through this FOA are expected to serve as major sources of discovery of the nature of cancer and of development of more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and therapy; to contribute significantly to the development of shared resources that support research; to collaborate and coordinate their research efforts with other NCI-funded programs and investigators; and to disseminate research findings for the benefit of the community.

The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/.

ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE.  In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology.

ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. 
  
ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.”  Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”)  should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity).

SBIR/STTR Program Overview:
The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are Government-wide programs authorized under Section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. § 638).  The objectives of the SBIR program are to (1) stimulate technological innovation in the private sector, (2) strengthen the role of Small Business Concerns in meeting Federal R&D needs, (3) increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R&D activities, (4) foster and encourage participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned Small Business Concerns, and (5) improve the return on investment from Federally funded research and economic benefits to the Nation. The objective of the STTR program is to stimulate cooperative partnerships of ideas and technologies between Small Business Concerns and partnering Research Institutions through Federally funded R&D activities. 

ARPA-E administers a joint SBIR/STTR program in accordance with the Small Business Act and the SBIR and STTR Policy Directive issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).  ARPA-E provides SBIR/STTR funding in three phases (Phase I, Phase II, and Phase IIS). 

Program Overview:
The Technologies to Emend and Obviate SYnthetic Nitrogen’s Toll on Emissions (TEOSYNTE) program aims to lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the cultivation of corn and sorghum used for United States ethanol production by 50%. The program will emphasize plant and microbial bio-design strategies that lower the application of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer on corn and sorghum fields while maintaining crop yields and reducing 50% of N2O emissions. Lowering the requirements of synthetic N fertilizer will also lower costs to farmers, as the cost of fertilizer is a significant portion of the operating expenses of a farm. This program will enable technologies to reduce N fertilizer consumption and N2O emissions. These technologies will transform agriculture and lower the N2O contribution to the carbon intensity (CI) of ethanol produced today for light duty vehicles and in the future for sustainable aviation fuel. 

Technologies developed under the TEOSYNTE program must achieve specific targets as outlined in Section I.E. in order to meet the program’s objectives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and N fertilizer usage over multiple seasons while maintaining crop yields.

Additional Information Agency Name: National Institutes of Health Description: The purpose of this FOA is to facilitate well planned clinical trials across the cancer prevention and control spectrum aimed at improving prevention/ interception, cancer-related health behaviors, screening, early detection, healthcare delivery, management of treatment-related symptoms, supportive care, and the long-term outcomes of cancer survivors. Although the scientific literature or preliminary data may provide the rationale for conducting a clinical trial, investigators often lack critical information about the study population, accrual challenges, intervention, outcome/ endpoints, data/statistical challenges or operational risks necessary to finalize the trial protocol completely. These information gaps can result in multiple protocol changes before and after trial start-up, leading to the need for additional time and expenses that may prevent study completion. Further, the suitability and feasibility of new trial designs, which minimize infrastructure and reduce costs may need to be tested in the context of a particular intervention, at-risk group, symptom or venue. Preparatory studies may fill information gaps and address unknowns, improving trial design and knowledge of trial feasibility and thus saving NCI time and money.

Additional Information Agency Name: National Institutes of Health Description: This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to provide support for research Centers that (1) conduct drug abuse and addiction research in any area of NIDAs mission, (2) have outstanding innovative science, (3) are multidisciplinary, thematically integrated, synergistic, and (4) serve as national resource(s) to provide educational and outreach activities to drug abuse research communities, educational organizations, the general public, and policy makers in the NIDA research fields. It is expected that a Center will transform knowledge in the sciences it is studying. Incremental work should not be the focus of Center activities; rather, new and creative directions are required. The P50 Center of Excellence is expected to foster the career development and mentoring of new investigators who would be given meaningful roles to play in the Center projects. A goal of this program is to create NIDA Centers that are national community resources for furthering drug abuse research by sharing their findings, their data, and their resources as appropriate  for researchers to use and build upon and to advance research in this field.

  -
Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) &ndash; doctoral degree granting IHEs accredited in, and having a campus located in, the U.S., acting on behalf of their faculty members.


*Who May Serve as PI:

The proposal must be submitted through regular organizational channels by the dissertation advisor(s) on behalf of the graduate student. The advisor is the principal investigator (PI) and the student is the co-principal investigator (co-PI). The student must be the author of the proposal. The student must be enrolled at a U.S. institution but need not be a U.S. citizen. To be eligible to serve as the PI, the advisor must be available during the period of proposal submission and review and during the performance of the research in order to relay information and communications from NSF to the student. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The Archaeology Program supports anthropologically relevant archaeological research. This means that the value of the proposed research can be justified within an anthropological context. The program sets no priorities by either geographic region or time period. It also has no priorities in regard to theoretical orientation or question and it is the responsibility of the investigator to explain convincingly why the focus of their research is significant and has the potential to contribute to anthropological knowledge. While the program, in order to encourage innovative research, neither limits nor defines specific categories of research, most applications either request funds for field research or the analysis of archaeological material through multiple approaches.

The PI must be the advisor of the doctoral student or another faculty member at the USIHE where the doctoral student is enrolled. The doctoral student must be a co-PI. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The Linguistics Program supports basic science in the domain of human language, encompassing investigations of the grammatical properties of individual human languages, and of natural language in general. Research areas include syntax, linguistic semantics and pragmatics, morphology, phonetics, and phonology.


The program encourages projects that are interdisciplinary in methodological or theoretical perspective, and that address questions that cross disciplinary boundaries, such as (but not limited to): What are the psychological processes involved in the production, perception, and comprehension of language? What are the computational properties of language and/or the language processor that make fluent production, incremental comprehension or rapid learning possible? How do the acoustic and physiological properties of speech inform our theories of language and/or language processing? What role does human neurobiology play in shaping the various components of our linguistic capacities? How does language develop in children? What social and cultural factors underlie language variation and change? The Linguistics Program does not make awards to support clinical research projects, nor does it support work to develop or assess pedagogical methods or tools for language instruction.


DDRI proposals to document the linguistic properties of endangered languages should be submitted to the Dynamic Language Infrastructure (DLI-DDRI) Program: https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19607/nsf19607.htm .

*Who May Serve as PI:

The proposal must be submitted through regular organizational channels by the dissertation advisor(s) on behalf of the graduate student. The advisor is the principal investigator (PI); the student is the co-principal investigator (co-PI). The student must be the author of the proposal.

To be eligible to serve as the PI, the advisor must be available during the period of submission, review, and performance of the research to relay information and communications from NSF to the student. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The primary objective of the Cultural Anthropology Program is to support basic scientific research on the causes, consequences and complexities of human social and cultural variability.


Contemporary cultural anthropology is an arena in which diverse research traditions and methodologies are valid in investigations of human cultural variation. Recognizing the breadth of the field's contributions to science, the Cultural Anthropology Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, fieldwork/lab-based theoretically engaged and methodologically sophisticated research in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology. Because the National Science Foundation's mission is to support basic research, the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice, humanistic understanding or applied policy. A proposal that applies anthropological methods to a social problem but does not propose how that problem provides an opportunity to make a theory-testing and/or theory-expanding contribution to anthropology will be returned without review.


Program research priorities include, but are not limited to, research that increases our understanding of: Sociocultural drivers of critical anthropogenic processes such as deforestation, desertification, land cover change, urbanization and poverty. Resilience and robustness of sociocultural systems. Scientific principles underlying conflict, cooperation and altruism, as well as explanations of variation in culture, norms, behaviors and institutions. Economy, culture, migration and globalization. Variability and change in kinship and family norms and practices. General cultural and social principles underlining the drivers of health outcomes and disease transmission. Biocultural work that considers the nexus of human culture and its relationship with human biology. Social regulation, governmentality and violence. Origins of complexity in sociocultural systems. Language and culture: orality and literacy, sociolinguistics and cognition. Theoretically-informed approaches to co-production in relation to scientific understandings of human variability and environmental stewardship. Mathematical and computational models of sociocultural systems such as social network analysis, agent-based models, multi-level models, and modes that integrate agent-based simulations and geographic information systems (GIS). Socio-cultural drivers of technology and technological systems such as AI, machine learning, augmented data, and platforms. As part of its effort to encourage and support projects that explicitly integrate education and basic research, CA provides support to enhance and improve the conduct of doctoral dissertation projects designed and carried out by doctoral students enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education who are conducting scientific research that enhances basic scientific knowledge.

The Department encourages applicants to propose strategies to achieve economic prosperity, address historical inequities, and provide equitable access and outcomes to marginalized groups. To meet the fluctuations in the population and changing needs of veterans experiencing and at risk of homelessness, DOL/VETS requires Federal financial assistance recipients to provide an array of client-centered services utilizing a case management approach that directly assists veterans experiencing and at risk of homelessness and provides critical linkages to a variety of support services available in their local communities. The HVRP approach is focused on obtaining high-quality career outcomes for the veteran. Veterans are to receive the job training and employment services required to re-enter and be successful in the labor force. To realize long-term benefits for veterans experiencing and at risk of homelessness, Federal financial assistance recipients must address the complex employment-related requirements and support services necessary to meet the needs of this population. This can be achieved either through direct services or through a robust referral system with established tools, resources, and partnerships to identify, recruit, prepare, and support veterans experiencing and at risk of homelessness for employment success. Through one of these methods, Federal financial assistance recipients will provide job placement, job training, job development, career counseling, and employment preparation services, among other services, to assist with obtaining meaningful, family-sustaining employment. The HVRP prioritizes ensuring fair and equitable treatment for all workers, providing opportunities for marginalized communities and ensuring accessibility for underserved communities. Federal financial assistance recipients will be better able to achieve more outcomes that are equitable for marginalized veterans by understanding the inequities that exist and by embedding equity into decision-making processes. Applicants are encouraged to address systemic and programmatic barriers that have created employment and economic inequities for historically marginalized populations, particularly Black, Latino, and Indigenous Native American persons, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; justice-impacted individuals, and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Questions regarding this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Forecast may be emailed to HVRPFOA@dol.gov however, please note there is limited information that may be shared with the public, as this FOA is currently under development.

Exchange alumni interested in participating in AEIF 2024 should submit proposals to embassyriga@state.gov by February 1, 2024. In 2022, the United States and Latvia celebrated 100 years of diplomatic relations. Today, the United States and Latvia are strategic partners, committed to defending our achievements and ensuring that future generations will have the same personal liberties, human rights, and economic freedoms that we enjoy. Looking to the future, our alliance faces new challenges: disinformation and malign influence; hybrid attacks; transnational corruption and crime and social divisions that threaten our stability and security. The Embassy seeks alumni projects that will help our alliance adapt and be resilient to the challenges posed by these complex issues and result in an even stronger U.S.-Latvia partnership. We invite our alumni to submit a project that will advance this vision. Proposals must address strengthening the resilience of the U.S.-Latvia partnership through strengthening the role of civil society, NGO’s and other democratic entities/mechanisms, emphasizing media literacy and countering disinformation, shining the light on the fight against corruption, promoting entrepreneurship and Transatlantic-oriented Economic policies, affirming the role of NATO, as well U.S. and Latvia commitment to it.

Phase I grants resulting from this competition will be made during FY 2025 to small businesses with maximum award sizes of $200,000 or $250,000. Refer to the individual topic for its respective maximum award size (a proposal submitted that exceeds the maximum award size for the respective topic will be declined without review). The period of performance will depend on the scope of the effort but will not exceed 12 months. Please note that the Phase II grant application will be due approximately 9.5 months after the grant start date. This will be the only opportunity to submit a Phase II application for a Phase I award made under this FOA. Grantees that select a Phase I period of performance of 9 months or less will be able to complete their Phase I project prior to submission of their Phase II grant application. Grantees that select a Phase I longer than 9 months will be able to continue research and development (R&D) after their Phase II application is submitted but will not be able to utilize these results in the preparation of their Phase II application. Phase I is to evaluate, insofar as possible, the scientific or technical merit and feasibility of ideas that appear to have commercial potential and/or substantial application in support of DOE mission research. The grant application should concentrate on research that will contribute to proving scientific or technical feasibility of the approach or concept. Success in a DOE Phase I is a prerequisite to further DOE support in Phase II. Only awardees issued Phase I grants under this FOA are eligible to submit a Phase II application under the corresponding FY 2026 Phase II FOA, i.e., FY 2026 Phase II Release 1. Approximately 40% of Phase I awardees submitting a Phase II application will receive a Phase II award. Instructions and eligibility requirements for submitting Phase II grant applications will be posted at a later date on the internet at https://www.grants.gov/ . The objectives of the SBIR/STTR programs include increasing private sector commercialization of technology developed through DOE-supported research and development (R&D), stimulating technological innovation in the private sector, encouraging participation by women-owned and minority-owned small businesses, and improving the return on investment from Federally funded research for economic and social benefits to the nation. DOE will support high-quality research or R&D on innovative concepts concerning important mission-related scientific or engineering problems and opportunities that have high potential for commercialization. The DOE SBIR/STTR Programs do not support either basic science or demonstration projects.

Research funded under this award mechanism will be hypothesis-driven, high-impact applied research that is relevant to Service Members, Veterans, their Families, and the American public. Applicants may leverage existing resources in translational research to address essential research ideas or unmet needs to enable the delivery of life-saving care to the Warfighter during prolonged and en route care in austere and combat environments. For this award mechanism, the definition of “leveraging” is as follows: an investigator basing a research project on existing resources in order to amplify potential gains in knowledge or accelerate technical maturity. Research of interest may include knowledge products, “knowledge resulting from research with the potential to improve individual or public health,”1 and solutions that can accelerate the introduction of military-relevant health products or technologies into clinical and/or operational use. Projects should take into consideration the varied expertise levels of targeted medical providers, available resources, and the possible diverse environmental conditions in combat situations. Proposal/application submissions are encouraged to include characteristics relevant to military use in the pre-hospital, combat operational setting. Submissions that propose solutions to advance civilian trauma care are not precluded, since civilian trauma and trauma care in the military are mutually influential and may be co-occurring in certain situations. Impact is a key component of this award mechanism. The potential impact of the research, both short term and long term, in addressing the FY24 CRRP Focus Area(s) should be clearly described. Successful high-impact research should lead to the accelerated translation of applicable advances for improving medical readiness, mitigating fatalities, optimally treating life-threatening injuries, and promoting positive long-term outcomes for military health and medicine, as well as the general public. Key aspects of the CRRP TRA Mechanism: • This BAA may be used to support applied, preclinical, clinical research, and/or small-scale clinical trials (e.g., first in human, phase 1/1b). • Preliminary data are required: Inclusion of preliminary data relevant to the proposed study is required. Applications in response to this BAA may not be used to support fundamental basic research. For this BAA, basic research is defined as research directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications toward process or products in mind. Applied and preclinical research, including animal studies, that is already supported by substantial preliminary or published data, and is designed to validate clinical translation, is appropriate for this award mechanism. Funding from this BAA may not be used to support studies requiring an exception from informed consent (EFIC). Funding from this BAA may not be used to support larger or advanced clinical trials (e.g., phase 2/3, pivotal). A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. Rigor of Experimental Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis, et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Women’s Health: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women's health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women’s health. Relevance to Military Health: Relevance to the health care needs the Warfighter ahead of deployment and in operational environments is a key feature of this award. Use of DOD or Department of VA Resources: Applications engaging investigators within the military Services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military Services, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and/or their Families. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research. Innovative research involving nuclear medicine and related techniques to support early diagnosis, more effective treatment, and improved health outcomes of active-duty Service Members and their Families is encouraged. Such research could improve diagnostic and targeted treatment capabilities through noninvasive techniques and may drive the development of precision imaging and advanced targeted therapies. The CDMRP intends that information, data, and research resources generated under awards funded by this program announcement be made available to the research community (which includes both scientific and consumer advocacy communities) and to the public at large. The funding instrument for awards made under this BAA will be assistance agreements, contracts, or Other Transactions. The type of instrument used to reflect the business relationship between the organization and the government is at the discretion of the government, in accordance with the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, as amended, 31 USC 6301-6308, which provides the legal criteria to select a procurement contract or an assistance agreement. The USAMRDC will also consider the use of Other Transactions (OTs) as a vehicle for award, in accordance with the conditions in 10 USC 4021 and 10 USC 4022. An assistance agreement can take the form of a grant or cooperative agreement. The level of involvement on the part of the CDMRP during the project’s period of performance is the key factor in determining whether to award a grant or cooperative agreement. If “no substantial involvement” on the part of the CDMRP is anticipated, a grant will be made (31 USC 6304). Conversely, if “substantial involvement” on the part of the CDMRP is anticipated, a cooperative agreement will be made (31 USC 6305). Substantial involvement means that, after award, CDMRP staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities. A contract is required when the principal purpose of the instrument is to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the U.S. government (31 USC 6303). An “Other Transaction” is appropriate to carry out certain prototypes, research, and production projects (10 USC 4021 and 10 USC 4022). Other Transaction authorities were created to provide the flexibility necessary to adopt and incorporate business practices that reflect commercial industry standards and best practices into its award instruments. The award type, along with the start date, will be determined during the negotiation process. The anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 CRRP TRA Award should not exceed $1.1M. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $3.3M to fund approximately three CRRP TRA Awards. Funding of applications/proposals received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications/proposals received, the quality and merit of the applications/proposals as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.

Additional Information Agency Name: National Institutes of Health Description: The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage applications from small business concerns (SBCs) to the newly re-authorized Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) program. The NOFO aims to facilitate the transition of previously or currently funded SBIR and STTR Phase II and Phase IIB projects to the commercialization stage by providing additional support for technical assistance and later stage research and development (R and D) not typically supported through Phase II or Phase IIB grants or contracts. This may include independent replication of key studies, Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, clinical studies, manufacturing costs, regulatory assistance, or a combination of services. Although a significant amount of the work in a CRP award may be subcontracted to other institutions, the Small Business Concern (SBC) is expected to maintain oversight and management of the R and D throughout the award.
Clinical Trials are not accepted under this NOFO.

They are of crucial importance for producing goods and services, creating value, providing jobs, and achieving social goals. The Science of Organizations (SoO) program funds basic research that yields a scientific evidence base for improving the design and emergence, development and deployment, and management and ultimate effectiveness of organizations of all kinds. 

SoO funds research that advances our fundamental understanding of how organizations develop, form and operate. Successful SoO research proposals use scientific methods to develop and refine theories, to empirically test theories and frameworks, and to develop new measures and methods. Funded research is aimed at yielding generalizable insights that are of value to the business practitioner, policy-maker and research communities. 

SoO welcomes any and all rigorous, scientific approaches that illuminate aspects of organizations as systems of coordination, management and governance. 

In considering whether a particular project might be a candidate for consideration by SoO, please note: Intellectual perspectives may involve (but are not limited to) organizational theory, behavior, sociology or economics, business policy and strategy, communication sciences, entrepreneurship, human resource management, information sciences, managerial and organizational cognition, operations management, public administration, social or industrial psychology, and technology and innovation management. Phenomena studied may include (but are not limited to) structures, routines, effectiveness, competitiveness, innovation, dynamics, change and evolution. Levels of analysis may include (but are not limited to) organizational, cross-organizational collaborations or relationships, and institutional and can address individuals, groups or teams. Research methods may be qualitative and quantitative and may include (but are not limited to) archival analyses, surveys, simulation studies, experiments, comparative case studies, and network analyses. Consistent with NSF merit review criteria, each SoO proposal should discuss both the intellectual merit and the potential broader impacts of the proposed research. SoO values basic research that has the potential to provide broader societal benefits. However, the majority of space in any proposal will need to be dedicated to the explication of theory, methods, and specific contribution to the evidence base about organizational effectiveness.

Projects that aim to implement and subsequently evaluate particular organizational training, effectiveness or change programs, rather than to advance fundamental, generalizable knowledge, are not appropriate for SoO.
Researchers who seek to conduct SoO-appropriate research in an industrial site and/or via an industry-university collaboration are invited to also look at the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry (GOALI) program web site .

*Who May Serve as PI:

For Track 1 (Institutional Capacity Building) and Track 2 (Implementation: Single Institution) projects, the Principal Investigator must be (a) a faculty member currently teaching in an S-STEM eligible discipline, or (b) an academic administrator who has taught in an S-STEM eligible discipline in the past two years. The Principal Investigator must be able to provide the leadership and time required to ensure the success of the project. Projects involving more than one department within an institution are eligible, but a single Principal Investigator must accept overall management and leadership responsibility. Faculty from all departments involved need to have roles in the project as either Co-Principal Investigators, senior/key personnel or scholar mentors. Other members of the S-STEM project senior leadership and management team may be listed as Co-Principal Investigators.


For Track 3 (Inter-institutional Consortia) projects, the Principal Investigator must be (a) a faculty member currently teaching in an S-STEM eligible discipline, (b) an academic administrator who has taught an S-STEM eligible discipline in the past two years, or (c) a non-teaching institutional, educational, or social science researcher investigating questions related to low-income student success. The Principal Investigator must be able to provide the leadership and time required to ensure the success of the project. Track 3 consortium proposals must have a Principal Investigator who accepts overall management and leadership responsibility across all consortia members. Faculty from all institutions and departments involved need to have roles in the project as either Co-Principal investigators, senior/key personnel or scholar mentors. Other members of the S-STEM project senior leadership and management team may be listed as Co-Principal Investigators or as Principal Investigators on collaborative research proposals.


Collaborative Planning grants are intended to help a collection of institutions plan for a future Inter-institutional Track 3 proposal. For Collaborative Planning grants, the Principal Investigator must be (a) a faculty member teaching in any S-STEM eligible discipline, or (b) a STEM administrator (department head or above) at one of the institutions within the envisioned inter-institutional consortia, or (c) a non-teaching institutional, educational, or social science researcher investigating questions related to low-income student success. The Principal Investigator on a Collaborative Planning grant must demonstrate the capacity to convene and lead a team of inter-institutional S-STEM eligible faculty, social science or educational researchers, and administrators focused on low-income student success to write the desired proposal in a 1-year timeframe. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: In 1998 Congress enacted the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act which provided funds to the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create a mechanism whereby the hiring of foreign workers in technology-intensive sectors on H-1B visas would help address the long-term workforce needs of the United States. Initially, scholarships were only provided for students in mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Later legislation authorized NSF to expand the eligible disciplines at the discretion of the NSF director. Undergraduate and graduate degrees in most disciplinary fields in which NSF provides research funding (with some exclusions described elsewhere in this document) are eligible as long as there is a national or regional demand for professionals with those degrees to address the long-term workforce needs of the United States.


The main goal of the S-STEM program is to enable low-income students with academic ability, talent or potential to pursue successful careers in promising STEM fields. Ultimately, the S-STEM program seeks to increase the number of academically promising low-income students who graduate with a S-STEM eligible degree and contribute to the American innovation economy with their STEM knowledge. Recognizing that financial aid alone cannot increase retention and graduation in STEM, the program provides awards to institutions of higher education (IHEs) not only to fund scholarships, but also to adapt, implement, and study evidence-based curricular and co-curricular [1] activities that have been shown to be effective supporting recruitment, retention, transfer (if appropriate), student success, academic/career pathways, and graduation in STEM.


Social mobility for low-income students with academic potential is even more crucial than for students that enjoy other economic support structures. Hence, social mobility cannot be guaranteed unless the scholarship funds the pursuit of degrees in areas where rewarding jobs are available after graduation with an undergraduate or graduate degree.


The S-STEM program encourages collaborations, including but not limited to partnerships among different types of institutions; collaborations of S-STEM eligible faculty, researchers, and academic administrators focused on investigating the factors that affect low-income student success (e.g., institutional, educational, behavioral and social science researchers); and partnerships among institutions of higher education and business, industry, local community organizations, national labs, or other federal or state government organizations, as appropriate.


To be eligible, scholars must be domestic low-income students, with academic ability, talent or potential and with demonstrated unmet financial need who are enrolled in an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree program in an S-STEM eligible discipline. Proposers must provide an analysis that articulates the characteristics and academic needs of the population of students they are trying to serve. NSF is particularly interested in supporting the attainment of degrees in fields identified as critical needs for the Nation. Many of these fields have high demand for training professionals that can operate at the convergence of disciplines and include but are not limited to quantum computing and quantum science, robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, computer science and computer engineering, data science and computational science applied to other frontier STEM areas, and other STEM or technology fields in urgent need of domestic professionals. It is up to the proposer to make a compelling case that a field is a critical need field in the United States.


S-STEM Eligible Degree Programs


Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Engineering, and Associate of Applied Science


Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Applied Science


Master of Arts, Master of Science and Master of Engineering


Doctoral (Ph.D. or other comparable doctoral degree)


S-STEM Eligible Disciplines


Disciplinary fields in which research is funded by NSF, including technology fields associated with the S-STEM-eligible disciplines (e.g., biotechnology, chemical technology, engineering technology, information technology, etc.).


The following degrees and disciplines are excluded: Clinical degree programs, including medical degrees, nursing, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, physical therapy, and others not funded by NSF, are ineligible degrees. Business school programs that lead to Bachelor of Arts or Science in Business Administration degrees (BABA/BSBA/BBA) are not eligible for S-STEM funding. Masters and Doctoral degrees in Business Administration are also excluded. Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact Program Officers before submitting a proposal if they have questions concerning degree or disciplinary eligibility.


The S-STEM program particularly encourages proposals from 2-year institutions, Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), predominately undergraduate institutions, and urban, suburban and rural public institutions.

Tribal Nations: An American Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges as a federally recognized tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 5130-5131. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The goal of Future Manufacturing is to support fundamental research, education, and training of a future workforce to overcome scientific, technological, educational, economic, and social barriers in order to catalyze new manufacturing capabilities that do not exist today. Future Manufacturing seeks inventive approaches to invigorate the manufacturing ecosystem and seed nascent future industries that can only be imagined today. Future Manufacturing supports research and education that will enhance U.S. leadership in manufacturing by providing new capabilities for companies and entrepreneurs, by improving our health, quality of life, and national security, by expanding job opportunities to a diverse STEM workforce, and by reducing adverse impacts of manufacturing on the environment. At the same time, Future Manufacturing enables new manufacturing that will address urgent social challenges arising from climate change, global pandemics and health disparities, social and economic divides, infrastructure deficits of marginalized populations and communities, and environmental sustainability. Future Manufacturing will complement existing efforts, supported by NSF and other federal agencies, in advanced manufacturing, but the focus of this program is to enable new, potentially transformative , manufacturing capabilities rather than to improve current manufacturing. Proposals that are incremental improvements over existing advanced manufacturing technologies will not be competitive.


The 2022 National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing (NSAM) shows how advances in U.S. manufacturing enable the economy to continuously grow as new technologies and innovations increase productivity, enable next-generation products, support our capability to address the climate crisis, and create new, high-quality, and higher-paying jobs. It highlights the need to enhance environmental sustainability and address climate change through objectives that include decarbonization of processes and sustainable manufacturing and recycling. The CHIPS and Science Act supports research and education in semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing and in other areas ranging from additive manufacturing to artificial intelligence. The recent Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy aims to expand domestic biomanufacturing capacity for products spanning the health, energy, agriculture, and industrial sectors.


Manufacturing in the future will rely on computation to ensure the reliable translation of product designs to manufacturing plans; process controls to assure those plans produce products that meet specifications; new materials, chemicals, devices, processes, machines, and design and work methods; systems that encompass people, processes, equipment, materials, and information within a production environment; and new social structures and business practices. Fundamental research to overcome significant barriers will be required in quantum and semiconductor devices and integrated systems, robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, sustainable chemistry and production, materials science, education and public policy, and workforce development.


Three thrust areas have been identified for support under this solicitation:


Future Cyber Manufacturing Research,


Future Eco Manufacturing Research, and


Future Biomanufacturing Research.


This solicitation seeks proposals to perform fundamental research to enable new manufacturing capabilities in one or more of these thrust areas.


This solicitation will support the following two award tracks:


Future Manufacturing Research Grants (FMRG) - up to $3,000,000 for up to four years; and


Future Manufacturing Seed Grants (FMSG) - up to $500,000 for up to two years.


Proposals should take a convergence approach that involves cross-disciplinary partnerships among engineers, scientists, mathematicians, social and behavioral scientists, STEM education researchers, and experts in arts and humanities. Team sizes should be commensurate with the scope of the plans for science, technology, innovation, and education and workforce development. 


Proposals that include significant participation from minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, community colleges, institutions from EPSCoR states, and/or incorporate expertise in improving diversity and inclusion are especially encouraged.


The goal of this solicitation is to enable new manufacturing that represents a significant change from current practice. Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include within the Project Description a section titled Enabling Future Manufacturing. Please see ""Proposal Preparation Instructions"" for additional details.


Realization of the benefits of the fundamental research supported under this solicitation will require the simultaneous education of a skilled technical workforce that can transition new discoveries into U.S. manufacturing companies. The National Science Board emphasizes this perspective in its report, "" THE SKILLED TECHNICAL WORKFORCE : Crafting America's Science and Engineering Enterprise."" Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include a plan to equip students and upskill the workforce to enable Future Manufacturing. Please see ""Proposal Preparation Instructions"" for additional details.


The results of Future Manufacturing could change how workers interact with technology. Investigators may choose to address challenges in this area by including an optional component of research which focuses on future workers and their interactions with the new technology. Please see ""Proposal Preparation Instructions"" for specifics.


FURTHER INFORMATION: Informational webinars will be held on February 2, 2024 from 1:00-2:00 PM EST and November 15, 2024 from 1:00-2:00 PM to discuss the Future Manufacturing program and answer questions about this solicitation. Details about how to join a webinar will be posted at https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/future-manufacturing-fm . A recording and transcript will be posted there soon after the webinar is held.

CED awards will be made as part of a broader strategy to address objectives such as decreasing dependency on federal programs, chronic unemployment, and community deterioration in urban and rural areas. CED projects are expected to actively recruit individuals with low income to fill the positions created by CED-funded development activities, to assist those individuals in successfully maintaining employment, and to ensure that the businesses and jobs created remain viable for at least one year after the project period. CED projects can be non-construction or construction projects, however, short-term construction jobs associated with preparing for business startup or expansion are not counted when determining the number of jobs created under the CED program as those jobs are temporary in nature.  OCS encourages applicants to target rural and underserved areas in states with current projects.Furthermore, OCS encourages potential applicants to explore how proposed projects can be aligned and/or integrated with other OCS-funded programs and priorities to more comprehensively address the needs of rural and urban communities with high rates of poverty, unemployment, and substance use disorder, as well as communities experiencing persistent poverty, as identified by US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.

The PI may perform the PI responsibilities while temporarily out of the U.S. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program aims to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance. Many NSF-funded projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-source products, including software, hardware, models, specifications, programming languages, or data platforms that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and/or government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.


POSE constitutes a new pathway to translate scientific innovations, akin to the Lab-to-Market Platform that NSF has pioneered over many decades. Whereas programs like the NSF Innovation Corps (NSF I-Corps™) and America’s Seed Fund[Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)] represent an integrated set of programs to provide researchers with the capacity to transform their fundamental research into deep technology ventures, POSE is specifically focused on another translational pathway – supporting the transition from open-source research artifacts to OSEs.


Importantly, the POSE program isnotintended to fund thedevelopmentof open-source products, including tools and artifacts. The POSE program is alsonotintended to fund existing well-resourced, open-source communities or ecosystems. Instead, the program aims to supportnewmanaging organizations to catalyze distributed, community-driven development and growth ofnewOSEs. The expected outcomes of the POSE program are to grow the community of researchers and innovators who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and to enable pathways for the safe and secure development of OSEs that have broad societal impacts. OSEs can emerge from any areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) research and development.


This solicitation seeks two types of proposals, allowing teams to propose specific activities toscope and planthe establishment of an OSE (Phase I), and toestablisha sustainable OSE based on a robust open-source product that shows promise in the ability to both meet an emergent societal or national need and build a community to help develop it (Phase II).


Phase I: OSE Scoping and Planning Proposals


Phase I projects are for open-source research products with a small community of external users though the product may not necessarily have external content developers. The objectives of Phase I projects are to: (1) enable scoping activities that will inform the transition of promising research products that are already available in open-source formats into sustainable and robust OSEs that will have broad societal impacts, and (2) provide training to teams interested in building such an OSE.


Phase I awardees are not obligated to submit Phase II proposals in the future.


Phase II: Establishment and Expansion Proposals


Phase II projects are for open-source research products with small, existing communities of external usersandexternal content developers. The objective of Phase II projects is to support the transition of a promising open-source product into a sustainable and robust OSE. Phase II proposal teams are expected to have already conducted the scoping activities needed to develop a detailed project plan to support the community-driven distributed development and deployment of successful open-source tools into operational environments (not necessarily via a Phase I award).


An NSF POSE Phase I award is not required for the submission of a Phase II proposal.

The program encourages theoretically focused empirical investigations aimed at improving the explanation of fundamental social processes. This includes research on organizations and organizational behavior, population dynamics, social movements, social groups, labor force participation, stratification and mobility, family, social networks, socialization, gender, race and the sociology of science and technology. The program supports both original data collection and secondary data analysis that use the full range of quantitative and qualitative methodological tools. Theoretically grounded projects that offer methodological innovations and improvements for data collection and analysis are also welcomed.


Principal Investigators should selectPD 98-1331in the program announcement/solicitation block on the proposal cover sheet for submission of regular research projects to the sociology program. Projects are evaluated using the two foundation-wide criteria, intellectual merit and broader impacts . In assessing the intellectual merit of proposed research, four components are key to securing support from the Sociology Program: (1) the issues investigated must be theoretically grounded; (2) the research should be based on empirical observation or be subject to empirical validation or illustration; (3) the research design must be appropriate to the questions asked; and (4) the proposed research must advance our understanding of social processes, structures and methods.


NSF also offers a number of specialized funding opportunities through its crosscutting and cross-directorate activities; some of the sociology-related opportunities are listed below.


Crosscutting Research & Training Opportunities: ADVANCE: Increasing the Participation and Advancement of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Careers Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program Mid-scale Research Infrastructure Programs SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program To get information about these programs and others, please visit the cross-cutting and NSF-wide active funding opportunities search page.

The goals of the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Program, created in 2011 by NSF,are tospur translation of fundamental research to the marketplace, to encourage collaboration between academia and industry, and to train NSF-funded faculty, students and other researchers in innovation and entrepreneurship skills.


The I-Corps Program utilizes experiential learning of customer and industry discovery, coupled with first-hand investigation of industrial processes, to quickly assess the translational potential of inventions. The I-Corps Program is designed to support the commercialization of ""deep technologies,” those revolving around fundamental discoveries in science and engineering. The I-Corps Program addresses the skill and knowledge gaps associated with the transformation of basic research into deep technology ventures (DTVs).


The purpose of the I-Corps Teams program is to identify NSF-funded researchers to receive additional support in the form of entrepreneurial education, mentoring, and funding to accelerate the translation of knowledge derived from fundamental research into emerging products and services that may attract subsequent third-party funding. The outcomes of I-Corps Teams' projects are threefold: 1) a decision on a clear path forward based on an assessment of the business model, 2) substantial first-hand evidence for or against product-market fit, with the identification of customer segments and corresponding value propositions, and 3) a narrative of a technology demonstrationfor potential partners.

Refer to the Program Definitions in Section I.A to review how these terms are defined in the PRO Housing program.Prospective eligible applicants with overlapping geographies (e.g., a county government and a city government located within that county) are encouraged to partner on a single application, rather than submitting two competing applications. Individuals, foreign entities, and sole proprietorship organizations are not eligible to compete for, or receive, awards made under this announcement. Additional Information Agency Name: Department of Housing and Urban Development Description: Communities nationwide are suffering from a lack of affordable housing, and housing production is not meeting the increasing demand for accessible and available units in many urban and rural areas, particularly areas of high opportunity. Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing (PRO Housing) empowers communities that are actively taking steps to remove barriers to affordable housing and seeking to increase housing production and lower housing costs over the long term. Barriers to affordable housing may take the form of restrictive zoning designations, land use policies, or regulations; discretionary, costly or prolonged procedures; deteriorating or inadequate infrastructure; lack of neighborhood amenities; neighborhood opposition to new or affordable housing; or challenges to preserving existing housing stock such as increasing threats from natural hazards, redevelopment that reduces the number of affordable units, displacement pressures, or expiration of affordability requirements.Across the United States, regulatory and other barriers have made it difficult to produce, preserve, and access affordable housing. Constrained supply drives up housing costs and reduces affordability. According to American Community Survey estimates in 2021, 39.3 million households (20.9 million renters and 18.4 million homeowners) have been classified as “cost-burdened,” spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing. Cost burden is even greater for underserved populations. Black families face affordability challenges as homeowners and renters more than any other racial or ethnic group, spending between 30 to 50 percent of their income on housing. In Puerto Rico, cost-burdened households face severe affordability challenges, spending between 50 to 90 percent of their income on housing. Limited access to housing has long-term effects on access to opportunity and ability to build generational wealth, especially for underserved communities of color and low-income people. Affordability challenges and the lack of affordable housing supply further increase eviction pressures and likelihood of homelessness for low-income people.In 2024, HUD awarded the inaugural PRO Housing competitive grants to 21 winners to advance housing opportunities in communities across 19 states and the District of Columbia. The first-round competition was greatly oversubscribed. For every dollar made available for fiscal year 2023, thirteen dollars were requested. HUD received over 150 applications from nearly every state and territory. The considerable interest in this first-of-its-kind funding is an indication of the need for resources to address barriers to housing production and preservation across the county. The applicants and winners represent rural, suburban, and urban communities ranging from under 5,000 residents to millions. While communities have seen historic levels of federal investments in housing and infrastructure, there is still a need to address the barriers that inhibit or slow housing production.  Barriers such as high cost of land, lack of available units, inadequate infrastructure, gaps in financing, restrictive zoning, risks of displacement, expiring affordability, and increased threats from extreme weather and an aging housing stock were common themes throughout the initial applications. PRO Housing funding enables awardees to address those barriers through planning, infrastructure, development, and preservation actions to further local housing goals.HUD is issuing this second PRO Housing NOFO under the authority of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118-42, approved March 9, 2024) (Appropriations Act), which appropriates $100 million for competitive grant funding for the identification and removal of barriers to affordable housing production and preservation. Congress has directed HUD to undertake a competition using the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) statutory and regulatory framework. Under this NOFO, HUD will provide PRO Housing grants to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation. Grantees may use awards to further develop, evaluate, and implement housing policy plans, improve housing strategies, and facilitate affordable housing production and preservation. Eligible applicants are State and local governments, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and multijurisdictional entities.HUD has six goals for this competition:Fairly and effectively award the PRO Housing grant funding;Elevate and enable promising practices dedicated to identifying and removing barriers to affordable housing production and preservation, while preventing displacement;Institutionalize state and local analysis and implementation of effective, equitable, and resilient approaches to affordable housing production and preservation;Provide technical assistance to help communities better fulfill the Consolidated Plan’s requirement of identifying barriers to affordable housing and implementing solutions to address these barriers;Affirmatively further fair housing by addressing and removing barriers that perpetuate segregation, inhibit access to well-resourced areas of opportunity for protected class groups and vulnerable populations, and concentrate affordable housing in under-resourced areas; andFacilitate collaboration and harness innovative approaches from jurisdictions, researchers, advocates, and stakeholders.HUD will prioritize applicants that demonstrate: (1) progress and a commitment to overcoming local barriers to facilitate the increase in affordable housing production and preservation, primarily by having enacted improved laws and regulations that HUD reasonably expects to preserve or produce new housing units; and (2) an acute need for housing affordable to households with incomes below 100 percent of the area median income.  If applicable, proposals should also explain how the funds will be used to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing by expanding access to housing opportunities in well-resourced areas for protected class groups. HUD will also prioritize applicants that demonstrate a commitment and ability to identify and remove barriers to: (1) expanding affordable housing in a manner that promotes desegregation; (2) expanding affordable housing in well-resourced areas of opportunity for protected class groups that have systematically been denied equitable access to such areas; or (3) deconcentrating affordable housing and increasing housing choice. HUD encourages applications that incorporate a discussion of key barriers related to land-use regulations, permitting, or related procedural issues. HUD further encourages applicants to outline and discuss how their proposed activities will advance equity, locate affordable accessible housing near transit and bolster access to services and opportunities, increase community resilience and mitigate the effects of natural and environmental hazards, and develop and preserve affordable housing in accordance with input from community members and other stakeholders.As with all CDBG assistance, the priority is to serve low- and moderate-income people.PRO Housing grantees must administer the PRO Housing grant in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, which means taking meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, to overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics. Specifically, affirmatively furthering fair housing means taking meaningful actions that, taken together, address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunities, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws.

•Federally recognized tribal governments"" Additional Information Agency Name: Department of Homeland Security - FEMA Description: Fiscal Year 2024 Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Swift Current aims to better align the delivery of FMA flood mitigation funding to the disaster survivor experience. The purpose of FMA Swift Current is to reduce or eliminate the flood risk to NFIP-participating communities and repetitive flood damage to structures and buildings insured by the NFIP following a flood-related disaster event, and to enhance community flood resilience within NFIP-participating communities. It does so by providing funding for mitigation opportunities immediately after a flood disaster event with the aim of delivering mitigation outcomes. Swift Current is a grant opportunity under the FMA grant program. The FMA grant program makes federal funds available to states, U.S. territories, federally recognized tribal governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and within NFIP-participating communities. It does so with a recognition of the growing flood hazards associated with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect to flooding. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future. Projects or initiatives that are eligible for funding under this announcement may or may not involve Geospatial (GIS) issues.

One of the goals of PEPFAR in Mozambique is to support efforts to achieve HIV epidemic control through implementation of evidence-based interventions to drive progress in HIV prevention, care and treatment and ultimately, save lives Through the P EPFAR Coordination Office , the U.S. Embassy in Maputo administers the Community Grants Program (formerly Small Grants) and is seeking proposals from registered community-based organizations whose mission and activities focuses on HIV programming. Objectives As PEPFAR continues to confront challenges with retaining HIV+ individuals in care and treatment programs, our collaboration with communities and patients is urgent and critical. Collaborating with community members that will identify barriers and enablers to accessing and utilizing HIV services will be key in im proving retention in Mozambique, as will ensuring stigma and discrimination surrounding HIV is addressed. Organizations will be expected to carry out patient surveys and gather information on the patient experience at health facilities. This information will then be used to facilitate dialogue and advocacy for improvement. Training and technical assistance will be provided to organizations selected for this award. This NOFO seeks eligible organizations to train, support, equip and compensate PLHIV to carry out routine monitoring of the quality of HIV treatment services received by patients at health facilities. We are looking for organizations that can help communities directly impacted by HIV to facilitate dialogue, based on patient experiences, that will help drive changes and improve HIV services in Mozambique. This mechanism will help PEPFAR programs, Public Health facilities and Local Government Institutions to gain insights on persistent problems impacting the quality of care of HIV and identify s olutions or enablers that will ensure that beneficiaries receive quality services and will encourage them to retain in care and adhere to their HIV treatment.

Eligibility Category: N on-profit Mozambican Community Based organizations (CBOs) that are led by People Living With or Affected by HIV and networks of Key Populations Executive Summary: The U.S. Embassy in Mozambique/Bureau of Africa at the U.S. Department of State (DOS) announces this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for Community-Led Monitoring. A Grant for up to $25,000 U.S. Dollars (USD) in FY 2022 will be awarded for work that will support Community-Led Monitoring. The expected period of performance is 12 months. Geographic Region: Projects which may be funded will cover the following Geographic Regions: PEPFAR-supported HIV treatment sites in Maputo Province, Inhambane Province, Gaza Province, Nampula Province, Manica Province, Sofala Province. Note: Projects will be in these provinces with districts and health facility sites determined after proposal selection and in coordination with other donors and implementing partners. Funder will ensure that sites will not overlap with current organizations supporting community led monitoring activities at the same health facility or in the same communities. The selection committee will endeavor to fund organizations in each of the selected provinces. Should there not be a proposal submitted from one of the provinces listed above, the discretion will fall to the PEPFAR Coordination Office to determine which additional organizations to fund. A.1. Background: The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) guidance for the Country Operational Plan for FY22 (COP 21) states that it is a minimum program requirement that HIV affected populations are provided continuous, quality, client-centered services, and that independent, routine, national community-led monitoring efforts to improve the accessibility and quality of services are part of the HIV response. Towards this end, the PEPFAR Coordination Office intends to finance Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and other civil society groups to initiate, lead, and implement community-led monitoring (CLM). Community-led Monitoring is an accountability mechanism for the national HIV response, led and implemented by local community-led organizations of people living with HIV (PLHIV), networks of Key Populations (KPs), or other affected groups. These organizations will document the experiences of beneficiaries of HIV services in a routine and systematic manner, using data routinely collected from clinic users by trained, paid clinic monitors. These data will focus on the accessibility and quality of HIV services. These data will be analyzed by communities and used to develop community-led interventions at the facility, district, provincial and national levels to correct the problems uncovered by community-led monitoring, ultimately leading to improved HIV outcomes. Technical assistance, including training on methods and tools as well as other needed support, will be provided to all recipient organizations. A.2. Program Objectives: Objectives and Expected Outcomes: The Recipient agrees to perform the program and meet the specific objectives below: Education on health-related rights for PLHIV; Listening, monitoring, and resolving complaints and concerns; Independent evidence-based advocacy based on findings from community-led monitoring. A.3. Expected Results Expected results include the following: Improve the quality of services provided at the health facility; Create demand for humanized health services; Increase the proportion of PLHIV on treatment retained in ART at the health facility. A.4. Main Activities To achieve the goals and expected results, the program should include the following: Implement 4 cycles of CLM, including quantitative and qualitative data collection (health facility observation and patient interviews, focus group discussions, individual testimonies and door to door interviews); Conduct community education sessions around health rights for PLHIV; Convene smaller groups to hear concerns/grievances regarding barriers to care and treatment; Participate in the health (community) and co-management (facility) committees; Collaborate with health facility staff to ensure presentation/discussion of grievances reported by patients and to seek resolution of grievances that meet the needs of patients and PLHIV; A.5. Performance Indicators The following are required indicators. Output 1: Number of barriers/grievances identified per session Output 2: Number of actions taken, and the results obtained based on grievances identified Output 3: Reach to patients at the health facility (numbers of unique patients reached with sessions) Other indicators will be developed according to the national CLM program guidance, which is currently being finalized.

Additional Information Agency Name: Department of Homeland Security - FEMA Description: Fiscal Year 2023 Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Swift Current aims to better align the delivery of FMA flood mitigation funding to the disaster survivor experience. The purpose of FMA Swift Current is to reduce or eliminate the flood risk to NFIP-participating communities and repetitive flood damage to structures and buildings insured by the NFIP following a flood-related disaster event, and to enhance community flood resilience within NFIP-participating communities. It does so by providing funding for mitigation opportunities immediately after a flood disaster event with the aim of delivering mitigation outcomes as quickly as possible. Swift Current is a grant opportunity under the FMA grant program. The FMA grant program makes federal funds available to states, U.S. territories, federally recognized Tribal governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and within NFIP-participating communities. It does so with a recognition of the growing flood hazards associated with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect to flooding. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future. Projects or initiatives that are eligible for funding under this announcement may or may not involve Geospatial (GIS) issues. Amendment #1 edits the Fiscal Year 2023 Flood Mitigation Assistance Swift Current Notice of Funding Opportunity to reflect change language and additional language based on feedback and questions from FEMA Regions and eligible applicants activated for Swift Current. .

DRMS supports research with solid foundations in theories and methods of the social and behavioral sciences. This social and behavioral science research should advance knowledge, address fundamental scientific and societal issues and have strong broader impacts. DRMS funds disciplinary and interdisciplinary research, doctoral dissertation research improvement grants (DDRIGs) and conferences in the following areas: judgment and decision making; decision analysis and decision aids; risk analysis, perception and communication; societal and public-policy decision making; management science and organizational design. The program supports the use of the RAPID funding mechanism for research that involves ephemeral data, typically tied to disasters or other unanticipated events. Much less frequently, the program also supports highly unusual, proof-of-concept, high-risk projects that are potentially transformational (Early Concept Grants for Exploratory Research – EAGER). For detailed information concerning RAPID and EAGER grants, please review Chapter II.E of the NSF PAPPG . All research must be grounded in theory and generalizable. Purely algorithmic management-science proposals should be submitted to the Operations Engineering (OE) Program rather than to DRMS. Decision, Risk and Management Sciences offers Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DDRIGs) to improve the quality of dissertation research.For detailed guidelines on preparing a DDRIG proposal, consult the separate DRMS-DDRIG solicitation .

The Biosensing program supports fundamental engineering research in the monitoring, identification and/or quantification of biological analytes and phenomena using innovations that exist at the intersection of engineering, life sciences, and information technology. Projects submitted to the program must advance both engineering and life sciences. The Biosensing program encourages proposals that, in addition to advancing biosensing technology, address critical sensor needs in biomedical research, public health, food safety, agriculture, forensics, environmental protection, and homeland security. Proposals are especially encouraged in areas of critical need: sensing technologies that can enable monitoring and surveillance of the environment and/or individuals for novel infectious agents; platform technologies that can readily be modified as soon as new agents are detected, sequenced, and/or otherwise characterized to enable rapid deployment of sensors in clinics and the environment; and adaptive and/or multiplex sensing technologies that can help the nation prevent the spread of the next global pandemic.


Major areas of interest for the program include: Novel signal transduction principles and mechanisms that enable sensitive and specific biosensors, suitable for measurements in multiple areas; Design of novel biorecognition elements and appropriately designed transducing systems to enable adaptable and/or reconfigurable operating parameters in response to environmental changes or application needs at levels of device, system, or data analysis; Development of adaptive and/or evolvable biosensing systems for detection of novel target analytes or analytes under novel conditions; Novel synthetic biology approaches for the development of cell-free and cell-based biosensors; and Combining biosensors with artificial intelligence (AI) methods to improve sensor specificity and response time. Innovative ideas outside of the above specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the PI contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.


The Biosensors program does not encourage proposals addressing circuit design for signal processing and amplification, computational modeling, and microfluidics for sample separation and filtration. Medical imaging-based measurements are outside of the scope of the program interests. Proposals that rely heavily on descriptive approaches are given lower priority. Proposals for optimizing and/or utilizing established methods for specific applications should be directed to programs focused on the application of sensor technology.


NOTE: Projects related to water and/or soil quality may be jointly supported with the Environmental Engineering program (CBET 1440). Photonic devices with medical imaging and/or optogenetics should be submitted to the Biophotonics program (CBET 7236). Applications of devices for tissue engineering or organ-on-chip systems should be submitted to the Engineering of Biomedical Systems program (CBET 5345). Basic chemical/biochemical sensing mechanisms should be submitted to the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program (CMI 6880) in the Division of Chemistry. Proposals for dynamic biosensing systems, including circuit design for signal/data processing and amplification, and sensing systems through communication and machine learning should be submitted to the Communications, Circuits, and Sensing-Systems program (CCSS 7564) in the Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems.


INFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS


Proposals should address the novelty and/or potentially transformative nature of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research.The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.


The duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of PI time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the ?What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)? link towards the bottom of this page.


Faculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged.Award duration is five years.The submission deadline for Engineering CAREER proposals is in July every year. Learn more in the CAREER program description .


Proposals for Conferences, Workshops, and Supplements: PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss their requests with the program director before submission of the proposal.


Grants forRapid Response Research(RAPID)andEArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research(EAGER)are also considered when appropriate. Please note that proposals of these types must be discussed with the program director before submission. Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)proposals that integrate fundamental research with translational results and are consistent with the application areas of interest to each program are also encouraged. Please note that RAPID, EAGER, and GOALI proposals can be submitted anytime during the year. Details about RAPID, EAGER, and GOALI are available in the Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide(PAPPG), Part 1, Chapter II, Section E: Types of Proposals.

The goals of the Catalysis program are to increase fundamental understanding in catalytic engineering science and to advance the development of catalysts and catalytic reactions that are beneficial to society. Research should focus on critical challenges and opportunities in both new and proven catalysis technologies. Areas of emphasis may include novel catalyst compositions, structures, operating environment, data science tools, theory, and modeling – preferably in various combinations as dictated by the specific reaction and related knowledge and technology gaps. Target applications include fuels, specialty and bulk chemicals, environmental catalysis, biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals, greenhouse gas mitigation, recycling of waste materials, generation of solar hydrogen, as well as efficient routes to energy utilization.


Heterogeneous catalysis represents the main thrust of the program. Proposals related to both gas-solid and liquid-solid heterogeneous catalysis are welcome, as are proposals that incorporate concepts from homogeneous catalysis. Recent research trends have highlighted the need for evaluation of catalyst performance and properties under working conditions, especially as supported by advanced in situ and in operando characterization methods. Catalyst synthesizability and stability present additional research opportunities given the harsh operating environments of many catalytic processes. 


Topic areas of particular interest include: Energy-related catalysis, utilizing renewable or sustainable energy in lieu of thermal, fossil fuel-based technologies, especially applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals, and also including fuel cell catalysis. Catalysis aimed at closing the carbon cycle (especially conversion of carbon dioxide, methane, and natural gas to fuels and chemical intermediates). Heterogeneous catalytic alternatives to traditionally non-catalytic or homogeneous reaction processes, as well as new catalyst designs for established catalytic processes. Environmental catalysis focused on mitigating both air and water pollutants, and supporting energy-efficient upcycling of waste materials to higher-value products. Catalytic remediation of feedstocks, process streams, products, or effluents. Commercially scalable methods of catalyst synthesis, including durable, poison-resistant, and easily regenerable catalyst formulations and designs. New catalytic materials and architectures (especially those substituting earth-abundant materials for precious and noble metal catalysts). Basic understanding of catalytic materials, reaction pathways, kinetics, and surface reaction mechanisms. Advanced tools for catalyst characterization and theoretical/computational catalysis. Proposals that deal with new catalytic materials, especially when viewed in light of the inherent complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, will be enhanced by including plans to assess: 1) reproducibility and repeatability of data, 2) stability under realistic operating conditions including start-up and shut-down cycles, 3) performance relative to standard or well-known reference materials, and 4) quantitative, well-accepted measures of catalyst activity, selectivity, and catalytic efficiency, such as turnover frequencies, quantum and/or photon yields of photocatalysts, Faradaic efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, and detailed product analyses and mass balances for the targeted application.


NOTE: Proposals that focus on 1) molecular or homogeneous catalysis, 2) the surface science of catalysis, 3) photo redox catalysis, 4) catalytic organic synthesis reactions, and/or 5) fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications of catalysis may be more appropriately submitted to the Chemical Catalysis program.(CHE 6884) in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals focused on biocatalytic processes, including proposals focusing on enzyme engineering, cellular and biomolecular processes, should be submitted to the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program (CBET 1491). If the proposal focuses on reaction engineering aspects of catalytic processes, submit to the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program (CBET 1403). Projects that are interdisciplinary in nature may be jointly funded with other CBET and NSF programs. Program directors will review the submissions and may transfer your proposal to give it the best review situation.


Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.

The goal of theProcess Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamicsprogram is to advance fundamental engineering research on the rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions, systems engineering, and molecular thermodynamics as they relate to the design and optimization of chemical reactors and the production of specialized materials that have important impacts on society.


The program supports the development of advanced optimization and control algorithms for chemical processes, molecular and multi-scale modeling of complex chemical systems, fundamental studies on molecular thermodynamics, and the integration of these methods and concepts into the design of novel chemical products and manufacturing processes. This program supports sustainable chemical manufacturing research on the development of energy-efficientchemical processes and environmentally-friendly chemical products through concurrent chemical product/process design methods.Sustainability is also enhanced by research that promotes the electrification of the chemical process industries over current thermally-activated processes.


Proposals should focus on: Chemical reaction engineering: This area encompasses the interaction of transport phenomena and kinetics in reactive systems and the use of this knowledge in the design of chemical reactors.Research areas include(1) development of novel reactor designs, such as catalytic and membrane reactors, micro-reactors, chemical vapor and atomic layer deposition systems, (2) studies of reactions in supercritical fluids, (3) novel reaction activation techniques such as atmospheric pressure plasmas (which may be submitted under the ECLIPSE meta-program) and microwave radiation, (4) design of multifunctional and intensified systems, such as chemical-factory/lab-on-a-chip concepts, (5) nanoparticle nucleation, growth, and surface functionalization, and (6) biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals.The program also supports new approaches that enable the design of modular chemical manufacturing systems such as distributed hydrogen and ammonia production processes. Process design, optimization, and control: This area encompasses process systems science, including the development of process modeling, design, control and optimization theory and algorithms; process development proposals are not appropriate for this program.High-priority research topics include process intensification, modular process systems, smart manufacturing, large-scale carbon dioxide capture and conversion, computational tools (including those based on quantum computing methods) enabling advanced chemical manufacturing, real-time optimization and control of large-scale chemical systems with quantitative sustainability metrics, machine learning, and optimization of enterprise-wide processes involving planning, scheduling, and real-time control to create resilient supply chains. Reactive polymer processing: Program scope in this area is limited to research that integrates synthesis and processing to engineer specific nanoscale structures and compositions to tune the macroscopic scale properties of polymers, such as their ability to biodegrade or to be recycled. The focus is on reactive processes that address these environmental concerns while producing tailor-made macromolecular materials. Molecular thermodynamics: This area focuses on fundamental research that combines principles of classical thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and atomistic-scale simulations to improve chemical processing and to facilitate synthesis of novel functional materials such as catalysts, polymers, solvents, and colloids. Topics include fundamental studies on self- and directed-assembly of nanoscale-level patterned polymer films, machine-learning methods to predict structure-property relationships, large-ensemble molecular dynamics simulations, simulation of peptide self-assembly and protein interactions, and behavior of multiphase and reactive systems under nanoscale confinement. The ultimate goal of research supported by this program is to enable the development of more efficient chemical processes, improve environmental sustainability and water quality, and design functional materials with tailored properties. Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered.However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.

The Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering program supports fundamental engineering research that will improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities through the development of new theories, methodologies, technologies, or devices. Disabilities could be developmental, cognitive, hearing, mobility, visual, selfcare, independent living, or other. Proposed projects must advance knowledge regarding a specific human disability or pathological motion or understanding of injury mechanisms.


Research may be supported that is directed toward the characterization, restoration, rehabilitation, and/or substitution of human functional ability or cognition, or to the interaction between persons with disabilities and their environment. Areas of particular interest are neuroengineering, rehabilitation robotics, brain-inspired assistive or rehabilitative systems, theoretical or computational methods, and novel models of functional recovery including the development and application of artificial physiological systems.


Emphasis is placed on significant advancement of fundamental engineering knowledge that facilitates transformative outcomes. The DARE Program encourages high-risk/high-reward proposals that surpass incremental technological improvements. The DARE Program also encourages participatory design and the inclusion of trainees with disabilities as part of the proposed research or broader impacts.


Innovative proposals outside of the above specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the PI contact the Program Director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.


NSF does not support clinical trials; however, feasibility studies involving human volunteers may be supported if appropriate to the project objectives. The development and application of artificial physiological systems that do not model functional recovery and instead improve fundamental understanding of physiological and pathophysiological processes would be appropriate for EBMS.


Furthermore, the DARE program does not support proposals having as their central theme commercialization of a product. Small businesses seeking early stage R&D funding for product development are encouraged to contact the NSF SBIR/STTR program in the America's Seed Fund within the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP).

  -
Organizations eligible to submit TCUP proposals are federally recognized Tribal Colleges and Universities, Alaska Native-serving institutions and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions. Multiple campuses of one university system are normally encouraged to consider collaborative submissions. Executive Order 13021 defines Tribal Colleges and Universities (""tribal colleges"") as those institutions cited in section 532 of the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 (7 U.S.C. 301 note), and other institutions that qualify for funding under the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978, (25 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), as well as Navajo Community College as authorized in the Navajo Community College Assistance Act of 1978, Public Law 95-471, Title II (25 U.S.C. 640a note). The term ""Alaska Native-serving institution"" means an institution of higher education that is an eligible institution under section 1058(b) of the Higher Education Act; and that, at the time of submission, has an undergraduate enrollment that is at least 20 percent Alaska Native students. The term ""Native Hawaiian-serving institution"" means an institution of higher education that is an eligible institution under section 1058(b) of the Higher Education Act; has a Carnegie classification of baccalaureate or associate's college; and has, at the time of submission, an undergraduate enrollment that is at least 10 percent Native Hawaiian students.  By signing and submitting the proposal, the proposer is certifying that they meet the eligibility criteria specified in this program solicitation. Willful provision of false information in this request and its supporting documents or in reports required under an ensuing award is a criminal offense (U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001).  Eligibility may be verified by consulting the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) or other certified federal government data sources.  Other institutions of higher education are eligible to submit collaborative proposals as non-leads with TCUP-eligible institutions under the TCUP Partnerships strands; limitations apply.


*Who May Serve as PI:

For the Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI), TCU Enterprise Advancement (TEA) Centers, and TCUP Partnerships award strands, the principal investigator (PI) is expected to be the president, chief academic officer, another senior academic officer responsible for oversight and management of curriculum and instructional policies for the institution, or a senior STEM faculty member. Typically, the PI for Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP) or TCUP for Secondary and Elementary Teachers in STEM proposals (TSETS) would be a member of the STEM faculty, but STEM education faculty are encouraged to be part of the key leadership team.  The PI for Small Grants for Research (SGR) proposals should be the lead researcher and would typically be a member of the STEM or STEM education faculty. For Cyberinfrastructure Health, Assistance, and Improvements (CHAI), the PI should be a senior STEM faculty member, but the chief information officer (CIO) is strongly encouraged to be part of the key leadership team.  Prospective PIs are encouraged to consult TCUP program staff. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) provides awards to federally recognized 1 Tribal Colleges and Universities, Alaska Native-serving institutions, and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions to promote high quality science (including sociology, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, economics and bioeconomics, statistics, and other social and behavioral sciences; natural sciences; computer science, including, but not limited to, artificial intelligence, quantum information science, and cybersecurity), technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), STEM education, research, and outreach. Support is available to TCUP-eligible institutions (see the Additional Eligibility subsection of Section IV of this solicitation) for transformative capacity-building or community engagement projects through Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI), Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP),TCUP for Secondary and Elementary Teachers in STEM (TSETS), TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers), Cyberinfrastructure Health, Assistance, and Improvements (CHAI), and Preparing for TCUP Implementation (Pre-TI). Collaborations led by TCUP institutions that involve non-TCUP institutions of higher education are supported through TCUP Partnerships, with the participation of other NSF programs to support the work of non-TCUP institutions.  Finally, research studies that further the scholarly activity of individual faculty members are supported through Small Grants for Research (SGR). Through the opportunities highlighted above, as well as collaborations with other National Science Foundation (NSF) divisions and directorates, and other organizations, TCUP aims to increase Native individuals' participation in STEM careers, improve the quality of STEM programs at TCUP-eligible institutions, and facilitate the development of a strong STEM enterprise in TCUP institutions' service areas. TCUP supports transformative capacity-building, community engagement, or research projects at TCUP-eligible institutions through the following funding tracks:


Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI) projects provide support to design, implement, and assess comprehensive institutional improvements in STEM education and research capacity at TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education. By strengthening STEM education and STEM education research, successful projects will increase the number of STEM students and improve the quality of their preparation. ICE-TI projects create and/or adapt and assess innovative models and materials for teaching and learning in STEM, embody knowledge about how students learn most effectively in STEM teaching and learning activities, and bring STEM disciplinary advances into the undergraduate or graduate experience. The objective of this strand is to expand STEM degrees offered by TCUP-eligible institutions or significantly enhance instructional approaches.



Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP) support the attainment of a short-term, well-defined goal to improve the quality of STEM education at an eligible institution. Targeted STEM Infusion Projects could, for example, enhance academic infrastructure by systematically adding traditional knowledge to the scope or content of a STEM course, updating curricula, modernizing laboratory research equipment, developing and delivering professional development for K-12 STEM educators, or improving the computational infrastructure. The objective of this strand is to expand STEM degrees or significantly enhance instructional approaches.



TCUP for Secondary & Elementary Teachers in STEM (TSETS) supports in-service professional development in STEM disciplinary or STEM education content and/or research for K-12 STEM teachers in the relevant service area. Examples of project activities include, but are not limited to, professional development involving seminar series and engagement in STEM instruction and content during the academic year, structured series of summer intensive workshops and trainings, and summer research opportunities. The objective of this strand is to broaden the instructional capacity for STEM in the K-12 workforce and thereby to the entire community, and to build the capacity for STEM disciplinary or education research among participating educational professionals. 



TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) coalesce the STEM and/or STEM education expertise into a team, designed to support and promote the STEM goals, needs, aspirations, or interests of the chartering reservation or tribe(s). TEA Centers may address a critical tribal or community need or focus on a realm of research or design that is beyond the scope of individual research grants or that is of interest to multiple tribes. The objective of this strand is to build on the capacity developed through prior TCUP support and apply expertise to collaborations with communities in the institutions service area, or nationally. 



The Cyberinfrastructure Health, Assistance, and Improvements (CHAI) strand supports projects at TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education to upgrade the cyberinfrastructure necessary to conduct, expand, manage and administer STEM programs of study, including research. The objective of this strand is to equip TCUP institutions to meet the demands of virtual instruction, advanced computing, and data science opportunities. 



Preparing for TCUP Implementation (Pre-TI) provides support for activities that prepare an institution for Implementation-level projects. Consequently, they are available only to TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education that have never received TCUP support, have not received TCUP support within the previous five years, or are embarking on a significantly novel STEM strategic plan. Examples of supported activities include completing an institutional assessment of its current STEM instructional capacity, or engaging in conversations necessary to formulate a shared vision of what that capacity should be and how to achieve it. Pre-TI awards can support staff and faculty release time, travel, stakeholder gatherings, and associated administrative costs. The objective of this strand is to conduct self-studies and formulate strategic plans for the development of STEM instructional programs of study. 



The TCUP Partnerships strand provides support for collaborations that will improve TCUP institutions' instructional and research capacity in STEM fields supported by NSF; attract, retain, and support TCUP students in internships and research endeavors deemed to be necessary for a complete curriculum offering; and engage partner universities to provide an academic grounding and a successful transition for students who wish to study or attain degrees in STEM fields supported by NSF. TCUP Partnerships broaden the number of scientific disciplines available to students at TCUP institution through collaborations with non-TCUP institutions.  Active Pre-Engineering Education Collaboratives or Partnerships in Geoscience Education awards are not affected by this revision. The objective of this strand is the development, through instructional and research capacity-building, of academic and career pathways for TCUP students through supporting collaborative projects between and among TCUP and non-TCUP institutions.  Interested teams of collaborators for which a TCUP institution serves as lead should contact the TCUP program directors.  Support for non-TCUP partners must be obtained from other NSF programs, which follows the procedures of the prior Partnership strands.



Small Grants for Research (SGR) strand support STEM or STEM Education faculty members at TCUP-eligible institutions to initiate or pursue research projects or programs that may include undergraduate or graduate student engagement. Awards are intended to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness; improve research and teaching at his or her home institution; create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning; and enhance the understanding of diverse groups' participation in STEM education practices and interventions. International research or collaborations are strongly encouraged. TCUP students may seek support for international research opportunities under the guidance of a TCUP STEM or STEM education faculty member and an international research collaborator. These awards are particularly appropriate as a means of recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientists, engineers, and educators at TCUP-eligible institutions. The objective of this strand is to support faculty research and professional development that build research capacity at TCUP institutions.

The project activities to promote human rights of vulnerable children in Haut-Katanga will: (1) conduct a “listening session” to learn more about the challenges children in Haut-Katanga face; (2) support local health and social service providers to better assist child victims of human rights abuses; (3) conduct brief surveys, both a baseline and end of project survey, to t rack increase in local knowledge of and attitudes towards children’s rights and how to protect them; (4) train local organizations to build the capacity of human rights defenders to support children and advocate for children’s rights; and (5) conduct a local education campaign on radio and other appropriate platforms.

Frequently Asked Questions: Question: In following the directions of the notification of funding opportunity, I would like to verify if an organization that is only registered in the DRC is eligible to apply. According to the directions: U.S. NGOs with 501(c)(3) status, and overseas-based non-profit/non-governmental organizations are eligible. Does this mean we would have to be a registered organization in both the United States and in the DRC? Or is this grant also open to a non-profit/non-governmental organization that is only registered in the DRC? Answer: Yes, nonprofits only registered in the DRC are allowed to apply. You do not need to be registered in both the US and the DRC. Thank you for your question!

Additional Information Agency Name: U.S. Mission to the Netherlands Description: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE U.S. EMBASSY THE HAGUE PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTION Notice of Funding Opportunity Funding Opportunity Title: Funding for New Counter-Disinformation Game Funding Opportunity Number: S-NL800-20-GR-3011 Deadline for Applications : August 19, 2021 6PM Local Time CFDA Number: 19.040 – Public Diplomacy Programs Total Amount Available: $275,000 A. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The U.S. Embassy The Hague Public Affairs Section announces an open competition for organizations to submit applications to 1)  produce an English- and Dutch-language pilot version of a counter-disinformation game (requirements below), 2) produce a French version of the game, 3) produce one additional translation into a European, Asian, and/or African language, to be determined at a later date 4) host the game on the company's own servers, and 5) develop and implement data collection and analysis methodologies to demonstrate the project’s achievement of expected results, and 6) promote games to target audiences. Please carefully follow all instructions below. Digital games have proven to be an effective tool in building cognitive resistance to disinformation across diverse environments and cultural contexts. The U.S. Embassy in The Hague is accepting proposals for the development of a digital game that incorporates active inoculation theory 1 along with other digital media literacy education methods in a fun, interactive experience targeting global internet users ages 15 and up. Primary gameplay should simulate the experience of engaging in common disinformation and propaganda activities, while educating the user on digital literacy applicable in the real world. Successful proposals will incorporate active inoculation theory and address current disinformation and propaganda tactics. The delivered product should be modular, scalable, and expandable so that later iterations could address additional problem sets, such as violent extremism and health misinformation. The game will be piloted simultaneously with players in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and lessons learned from these pilots will inform the final version of the game intended ultimately for global audiences. The next translation will be produced for French speakers in Europe and Africa, followed by one more translation into a European, Asian, or African language to be determined later. Ideally, the proposed project would use in-game surveys or other in-game methods to measure effectiveness. The total amount of funds available for a successful proposal would be $275,000. Priority Region: Global Program Goal: Degrade malign actors’ ability to diffuse disinformation among target audiences. Expected Results Objective 1: Target audiences have increased their ability to discern disinformation, self-confidence in these abilities, and motivation to share factual narratives. Outcome 1.1: Members of the target audiences played the game to completion. Output 1.1.1: Produced counter-disinformation game consistent with funding requirements. Output 1.1.2: Launched pilot versions and gathered lessons learned Output 1.1.3: Updated game based on pilot lessons learned Output 1.1.4: Translated and launched game for specific target audiences. Output 1.1.5: Promoted game through key channels for each target audience Outcome 1.2: Players of the game participated in pre and post survey to gauge the effectiveness of the game. Output 1.2.1: Developed and implemented methodology to collect and analyze data on the effectiveness of the game. Main Activities To contribute to the stated goals and achieve expected results, the awardee will carry out the following activities: ·        Produce an English- and Dutch-language pilot version of a counter-disinformation game and gather lessons learned ·        Produce a translation for a French-speaking audience ·        Produce a translation of the gameinto one more European, Asian, or African language (to be determined in consultation with Grant Administrators during development) ·        Host the game on the company's own servers ·        Develop and implement data collection and analysis methodologies to demonstrate the project’s achievement of expected results ·        Promote games including translated versions to target audiences, may use up to $10,000 of award funds for paid promotion (paid promotion is optional) Performance Indicators The project should monitor and report on performance indicators that are specific, measurable, achievable, reasonable, and time-bound. Prior to implementation, the implementer shall produce a monitoring and evaluation plan documenting indicators for each expected result, key definitions, performance baselines (where possible), performance targets, justification of performance targets, sources of data, methods of data collection, methods of analysis, frequency of measurement, and units of measurement.  In addition to disaggregation by target audiences, all indicators should also be disaggregated by sex and age where feasible. Preferably, the project should establish an automated means of collecting and analyzing performance metrics, with a dashboard displaying these metrics for easy sharing or review by Grant Administrators. Potential indicators may include: Objective 1 ·        Average change in surveyed individuals’ abilities to discern disinformation ·        Average change in surveyed individuals’ self-confidence in discerning disinformation ·        Average change in the proportion of surveyed individuals reporting that they are less likely to share disinformation and more likely to share factual narratives Outcome 1.1 ·        # of individuals that completed the game ·        # of individuals that started but did not complete the game Output 1.1.1 ·        # of counter-disinformation games produced and launched following funding requirements Output 1.1.2 ·        # of pilot versions launched Output 1.1.3 ·        # of updated games produced based on pilot lessons learned Output 1.1.4 ·        # of translated versions produced and launched Output 1.1.5 ·        # of promotion activities conducted, by type of promotion (ex. social media ads) ·        # of individuals reached by promotion activities ·        # of articles covering project-funded game ·        # of key stakeholders promoting project-funded game Outcome 1.2 ·        # of individuals that completed the pre and post surveys ·        # of individuals that responded to pre and post surveys Output 1.2.1 ·        # of survey methodologies developed to measure the effectiveness of the game in Objective 1 ·        # of times that the developed data collection method was implemented Link to Additional Information: U.

Scientists in upper middle-income LMICs (UMICs) are also eligible to partner directly with scientists at other LMIC institutions with or without out a US partner.  Income categories used are as defined by the World Bank at http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups. These grants are expected to foster the development of more comprehensive research programs that contribute to the long-term goals of building sustainable research capacity in LMICs to address nervous system development, function and impairment throughout life and to lead to diagnostics, prevention, treatment and implementation strategies. The proposed work may also contribute to developing a base for research networking and evidence-based policy beyond the specific research project.

Additional Information Agency Name: National Institutes of Health Description: The purpose of the Research Enhancement Award Program (REAP) for Health Professional Schools and Graduate Schools is to stimulate basic and clinical research in educational institutions that provide baccalaureate or advanced degrees for a significant number of the Nation's research scientists, but that have not been major recipients of NIH support. REAP grants create opportunities for scientists and institutions otherwise unlikely to participate extensively in NIH research programs to contribute to the Nation's biomedical and behavioral research effort. REAP grants are intended to support small-scale research projects proposed by faculty members of eligible, domestic institutions, to expose undergraduate and/or graduate students at health professional schools or graduate schools to meritorious research projects, and to strengthen the research environment of the applicant institution. Eligible institutions must award NIH-relevant baccalaureate or advanced degrees in health professions and have received less than $6 million per year of NIH support (total costs) in 4 of the last 7 fiscal years. In this FOA, a college is a stand-alone entity and not a component of a university system.

Organizations outside the U.S. that propose on the basis of a policy of no-exchange-of-funds; consult the NASA Proposer’s Guide (https://www.nasa.gov/general/grants-policy-and-compliance-team/ - section-2) for specific details. Some NRAs may be issued jointly with a non-U.S. organization, e.g., those concerning guest observing programs for jointly sponsored space science programs, that will contain additional special guidelines for non-U.S. participants. Also reference the Proposer’s Guide for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested. Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: This program element does not have a proposal due date. Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance, see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1). The date shown of 3/28/2025 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-24 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-25 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-24 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list . Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/ , and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Organizations outside the U.S. that propose on the basis of a policy of no-exchange-of-funds; consult the NASA Proposer’s Guide (https://www.nasa.gov/general/grants-policy-and-compliance-team/ - section-2) for specific details. Some NRAs may be issued jointly with a non-U.S. organization, e.g., those concerning guest observing programs for jointly sponsored space science programs, that will contain additional special guidelines for non-U.S. participants. Also reference the Proposer’s Guide for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested. Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: This program element does not have a proposal due date. Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance, see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1). The date shown of 3/28/2025 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-24 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-25 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-24 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list .

Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list . Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/ , and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list . Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES.

Organizations outside the U.S. that propose on the basis of a policy of no-exchange-of-funds; consult the NASA Proposer’s Guide (https://www.nasa.gov/general/grants-policy-and-compliance-team/ - section-2) for specific details. Some NRAs may be issued jointly with a non-U.S. organization, e.g., those concerning guest observing programs for jointly sponsored space science programs, that will contain additional special guidelines for non-U.S. participants. Also reference the Proposer’s Guide for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested. Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: The close date above is the date for the Step-1 proposal submission. See the solicitation for the Step-2 due date.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements.

Organizations outside the U.S. that propose on the basis of a policy of no-exchange-of-funds; consult the NASA Proposer’s Guide (https://www.nasa.gov/general/grants-policy-and-compliance-team/ - section-2) for specific details. Some NRAs may be issued jointly with a non-U.S. organization, e.g., those concerning guest observing programs for jointly sponsored space science programs, that will contain additional special guidelines for non-U.S. participants. Also reference the Proposer’s Guide for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested. Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: This program element does not have a proposal due date. Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance, see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1). The date shown of 3/28/2025 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-24 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-25 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-24 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list . Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/ , and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

LEAPS-MPS has the additional goal of achieving excellence through diversity and aims to broaden participation to include members from groups historically excluded and currently underrepresented in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences, including Blacks and African Americans, Hispanics, Latinos, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Native Pacific Islanders. These grants are intended to support MPS principal investigators, particularly at the aforementioned institutions, for whom LEAPS funding would enable the PI to submit a subsequent successful proposal to a traditional, already-existing NSF funding opportunity, such as individual investigator programs, CAREER competitions, etc. By providing this funding opportunity, MPS intends to help initiate viable independent research programs for researchers attempting to launch their research careers such that LEAPS-MPS awards are followed by competitive grant submissions that build upon the research launched through this mechanism. This LEAPS-MPS solicitation welcomes proposals from principal investigators who share NSF's commitment to diversity. Awards are for 24 months and are up to $250,000 total costs (direct plus indirect). Proposals in response to this solicitation must be submitted for consideration tothe appropriate program in one of the five MPS Divisions.

This transformation offers great promise for improved wellbeing and prosperity but poses significant challenges at the complex intersection of technology and society. The goal of the NSF Smart and Connected Communities (S&CC) program solicitation is to accelerate the creation of the scientific and engineering foundations that will enable smart and connected communities to bring about new levels of economic opportunity and growth, safety and security, health and wellness, accessibility and inclusivity, and overall quality of life.


For the purposes of this solicitation, communities are defined as having geographically-delineated boundaries—such as towns, cities, counties, neighborhoods, community districts, rural areas, and tribal regions—consisting of various populations, with the structure and ability to engage in meaningful ways with proposed research activities. A “smart and connected community” is, in turn, defined as a community that synergistically integrates intelligent technologies with the natural and built environments, including infrastructure, to improve the social, economic, and environmental well-being of those who live, work, learn, or travel within it.


The S&CC program encourages researchers to work with community stakeholders to identify and define challenges they are facing, enabling those challenges to motivate use-inspired research questions. For this solicitation, community stakeholders may include some or all of the following: residents, neighborhood or community groups, nonprofit or philanthropic organizations, businesses, as well as municipal organizations such as libraries, museums, educational institutions, public works departments, and health and social services agencies. The S&CC program supports integrative research that addresses fundamental technological and social science dimensions of smart and connected communities and pilots solutions together with communities. Importantly, this program is interested in projects that consider the sustainability of the research outcomes beyond the life of the project, including the scalability and transferability of the proposed solutions.


This S&CC solicitation will support research projects in the following categories: S&CC Integrative Research Grants (SCC-IRG) Tracks 1 and 2. Awards in this category will support fundamental integrative research that addresses technological and social science dimensions of smart and connected communities and pilots solutions together with communities. Track 1 proposals may request budgetsranging between $1,500,001 and $2,500,000, with durations of up to four years.

The goal of theElectrochemical Systemsprogram is to support fundamental engineering science research that will enable innovative processes involving electrochemistry or photochemistry for the sustainable production of electricity, fuels, chemicals, and other specialty and commodity products. Processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry for sustainable energy and chemical production must be scalable, environmentally benign, reduce greenhouse gas production, and utilize renewable resources. Research projects that stress fundamental understanding of phenomena that directly impact key barriers to improved system or component-level performance (for example, energy efficiency, product yield, process intensification) are encouraged. Processes for energy storage should address fundamental research barriers for renewable electricity storage applications, for transport propulsion, or for other applications that could have impact towards climate change mitigation. For projects concerning energy storage materials, proposals should involve testable hypotheses that involve device or component performance characteristics that are tied to fundamental understanding of transport, kinetics, or thermodynamics. Advanced chemistries beyond lithium-ion are encouraged. Proposed research on processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry should be inspired by the need for economic and impactful conversion processes.


All proposal project descriptions should address how the proposed work, if successful, will improve process realization and economic feasibility and compare the proposed work against current state of the art. Highly integrated multidisciplinary projects are encouraged. When appropriate, collaborations with industrial technologists are encouraged through GOALI proposals. Collaborative projects with an integrated experimental and theoretical approach are also encouraged.


Topics of interest include electrochemical energy storage and electrochemical production/conversion systems. Radically new battery systems can move the U.S. more rapidly toward a more sustainable transportation future and to greater renewable electricity production penetration. High-energy density and high-power density batteries suitable for transportation and renewable energy storage applications are of primary interest. Advanced systems involving metal anodes, solid-state electrolytes, nonaqueous systemsbeyond lithium, aqueous systems beyond lithium,and multivalent chemistries are encouraged. Research activities focused on commercially available systems such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride batteries or lithium-ion batteries for medical or consumer electronics applications will not be considered by this program. Novel electrochemical and photochemical systems and processes for the production of chemicals and high-value products are encouraged. Emphasis is placed on those systems that improve process intensification and process modularization with accompanying benefits in energy efficiency and environmental footprint.


Additional fundamental science topics of interest to this program include the study of: advanced fuel cell systems or fuel cell components for transportation propulsion or grid energy storage applications; flow batteries for stationary energy storage applications including alternative redox chemistries (e.g., organic, inorganic, organometallic, macromolecular) and operating strategies (e.g., redox-mediation, suspensions); and photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical processes and devices for the splitting of water into hydrogen gas or for the reduction of carbon dioxide to liquid or gaseous fuels. Projects that largely focus on developing fundamental understanding of the catalytic reaction mechanisms and structure-function relationships may be more appropriate as submissions to the CBET Catalysis program (CBET 1401). Projects submitted to the Electrochemical Systems program are expected to develop fundamental, molecular-level understanding of the key chemical reaction and transport phenomena barriers to improved system-level performance. Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.


Referrals to other programs within NSF: Proposals that focus on electric-field driven separations such as dielectrophoresis should be directed to theInterfacial Engineeringprogram (CBET 1417). Proposals that focus on thermal management of energy storage devices and systems should be submitted to theThermal Transport Processesprogram (CBET 1406). Proposals that focus on improving device and system performance of primarily organic, inorganic, and hybrid photovoltaic (PV) technologies, including perovskites, may be more appropriate as submissions to the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices program in Engineering's Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems (ECCS 1517). PV materials proposals that focus on the material science may be considered in the Division of Materials Research of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals that focus on the generation of thermal energy by solar radiation should be directed to theThermal Transport Processesprogram (CBET 1406). INFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS

The goal of theEnvironmental Sustainabilityprogram is to promote sustainable engineered systems that support human well-being and that are also compatible with sustaining natural (environmental) systems. These systems provide ecological services vital for human survival. Research efforts supported by the program typically consider long time horizons and may incorporate contributions from the social sciences and ethics. The program supports engineering research that seeks to balance society's need to provide ecological protection and maintain stable economic conditions.


There are five principal general research areas that are supported. Circular Bioeconomy Engineering:This area includes research that enables sustainable societal use of food, energy, water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and materials, with the reduction and eventual elimination of fossil fuel combustion that lacks carbon capture. The program encourages research that helps build the raw material basis for the functioning of society principally on biomass, drawing heavily on sustainable agriculture and forestry. Additionally, material flows must reduce or preferably eliminate waste, with an emphasis on closed-loop or “circular” processing. Industrial ecology:Topics of interest include advancements in modeling such as life cycle assessment, materials flow analysis, net energy analysis, input/output economic models, and novel metrics for measuring sustainable systems. Innovations in industrial ecology are encouraged. Green engineering:Research is encouraged to advance the sustainability of manufacturing processes, green buildings, and infrastructure. Many programs in the Engineering Directorate support research in environmentally benign manufacturing or chemical processes. The Environmental Sustainability program supports research that would affect more than one chemical or manufacturing process or that takes a systems or holistic approach to green engineering for infrastructure or green buildings. Improvements in distribution and collection systems that will advance smart growth strategies and ameliorate effects of growth are research areas that are supported by Environmental Sustainability. Innovations in management of storm water, recycling and reuse of drinking water, and other green engineering techniques to support sustainability may also be fruitful areas for research. Ecological engineering:Proposals should focus on the engineering aspects of restoring ecological function to natural systems. Engineering research in the enhancement of natural capital to foster sustainable development is encouraged. Earth systems engineering:Earth systems engineering considers aspects of large-scale engineering research that involve mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to climate change, and other global concerns. All proposed research should be driven by engineering principles, and be presented explicitly in an environmental sustainability context. Proposals should include involvement in engineering research of at least one graduate student, as well as undergraduates. Incorporation of aspects of social, behavioral, and economic sciences is welcomed.


NOTE: Water treatment, air pollution (both outdoor and indoor), soil remediation, and solid waste treatment proposals are to besubmitted to theEnvironmental Engineeringprogram (CBET 1440).


Innovative proposals outside the scope of the four core areas mentioned above may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review. For proposals that call for research to be done on regions that are outside of the United States, an explanation must be presented of the potential benefit of the research for the United States.

Also reference the Proposer’s Guide for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested. Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: This program element does not have a proposal due date. Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance, see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1). The date shown of 3/28/2025 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-24 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-25 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-24 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements.

The goal of theEngineering of Biomedical Systems(EBMS) program is to provide opportunities for fundamental and transformative research projects that integrate engineering and life sciences to solve biomedical problems and serve humanity in the long term. Projects are expected to use an engineering framework (for example, design or modeling) that supports increased understanding of physiological or pathophysiological processes. Projects must include objectives that advance both engineering and biomedical sciences.


Projects may include: methods, models, and enabling tools applied to understand or control living systems; fundamental improvements in deriving information from cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems; or new approaches to the design of systems that include both living and non-living components for eventual medical use in the long term.


TheEBMS programsupports fundamental and transformative research in the following areas of biomedical engineering: Developmentof validated models (living or computational) of healthy and pathological tissues and organ systems that can support improved fundamental understanding of these systems or that could be applied in the future for development and testing of medical interventions; Designand validation of systems that integrate living and non-living componentsfor improved understanding of physiology that could be applied in the future for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment ofdisease or injury; Design and subsequent application of technologies andtools toinvestigate fundamental physiological and pathophysiological processes; Advancedbiomanufacturing of three-dimensional tissues and organs; and Application of engineering tools and principles, including mathematical modeling, to quantitatively study the immune system in health and disease and to develop techniques for controlling and modulating a host’s immune response to challenges such as infectious diseases, cancer, implants, autoimmune disorders, wounds, etc. The long-term impact of the projects can be related to effective disease diagnosis and/or treatment, or improved health care delivery. However, immediate goals should focus on improved fundamental understanding of cell and tissue function in normal or pathological conditions and advancing biomedical engineering.


Innovative proposals outside of these specific areas of biomedical engineering may be considered.However, prior to submission, it is strongly recommended that the PIs contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review. Related programs also fund biomedical engineering research, and PIs are encouraged to examine these to find the appropriate program for submission.


The EBMS program does not support proposals having as their central theme drug design and delivery, the development of biomedical devices that do not include a living biological component, or thedevelopment of animal models of disease.For consideration by the EBMS program, proposals that advance the design of tools or technologies should also apply those technologies to advance knowledge in biomedical science. NSF does not support clinical trials; however, feasibility studies involving human volunteers may be supported if appropriate to the project objectives.


Projects with a central focus on design or optimization of a device, material, algorithm, or process alone without exploring new fundamental biomedical science are not appropriate for the EBMS program. Furthermore, although research on biomaterials, cellular biomechanics, manufacturing systems, or algorithm/device design may constitute a part of the proposed studies, such research can be more appropriately targeted to other NSF programs: Projects that aim to improve protein engineering or cellular biomanufacturing - either manufacturing cells or cell-derived products - should consider the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering (CBE) program. Projects that focus on the development and application of microphysiological systems that model functional recovery related to a specific human disability or injury mechanism should consider the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering (DARE) program. Biomaterials-focused projects should consider the Biomaterials (BMAT) program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR). Cellular and tissue biomechanics projects should consider the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI). Manufacturing systems proposals should consider the Advanced Manufacturing(AM) program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI). Innovative research on signal processing techniques or dynamic biosensing systems should consider the Communications, Circuits, and Sensing-Systems (CCSS) program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS). Innovative research on novel devices based on the principles of electronics, optics and photonics, optoelectronics, magnetics, opto- and electromechanics, electromagnetics, and related physical phenomena, also including material-device interaction, should consider the Electronics, Photonics and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).

A quantitative treatment of problems related to biological processes is considered vital to successful research projects in the CBE program.


Major areas of interest for the program include: Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology for biomanufacturing, The design of synthetic metabolic components and synthetic cells, Microbiome structure, function, maintenance, and design, Protein and enzyme engineering, and Design of integrated chemoenzymatic systems. The CBE program also encourages proposals that effectively integrate knowledge and practices from different disciplines while incorporating ongoing research into educational activities.


All proposals should include a description on the potential impact of proposed research on an associated biomanufacturing process.


Proposals whose core innovation involves tissue engineering, organ culture, development of models of healthy or diseased physiology, or design and application of technologies focused on the diagnosis or treatment of disease should be submitted to theEngineering ofBiomedicalSystemsprogram(CBET 5345). Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review. INFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS Proposals should address the novelty and/or potentially transformative nature of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field. Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact of success in the research on society and/or industry. The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.


The duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of principal investigator time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the Program Director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the “What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)” link towards the bottom of this page. Faculty Early Career Development(CAREER) program proposals are strongly encouraged. Award duration is five years. The submission deadline for Engineering CAREER proposals is in July every year. Learn more in the CAREER program description . Proposals for Conferences, Workshops, and Supplements : Principal Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their requests with the Program Director before submission of the proposal. Grants forRapid Response Research(RAPID) and EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research(EAGER) are also considered when appropriate. Please note that proposals of these types must be discussed with the program director before submission. Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) proposals that integrate fundamental research with translational results and are consistent with the application areas of interest to each program are also encouraged. Please note that RAPID, EAGER, and GOALI proposals can be submitted anytime during the year. Details about RAPID, EAGER, and GOALI are available in the Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide(PAPPG), Part 1, Chapter II, Section E: Types of Proposals. Compliance : Proposals that are not compliant with the Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) will be returned without review.

Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: This program element does not have a proposal due date. Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance, see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1). The date shown of 3/28/2025 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-24 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-25 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-24 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list . Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/ , and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Organizations outside the U.S. that propose on the basis of a policy of no-exchange-of-funds; consult the NASA Proposer’s Guide (https://www.nasa.gov/general/grants-policy-and-compliance-team/ - section-2) for specific details. Some NRAs may be issued jointly with a non-U.S. organization, e.g., those concerning guest observing programs for jointly sponsored space science programs, that will contain additional special guidelines for non-U.S. participants. Also reference the Proposer’s Guide for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested. Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: This program element does not have a proposal due date. Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance, see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1). The date shown of 3/28/2025 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-24 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-25 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-24 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list . Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/ , and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Recent research shows that science scholars who are underrepresented in STEM produce higher rates of scientific novelty, yet they do not persist in the systems where the innovation is created (Hofstra et al. 2020). Because the geosciences continue to lag other STEM fields in creating a diverse community of researchers, scholars, and practitioners, disruptive strategies and evidence-based practices are needed to recruit and specifically retain individuals who historically have not been included in geoscience education, research and careers.


The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) seeks to support activities that will develop unique approaches or bring to scale current efforts to increase and sustain the inclusion of individuals from diverse backgrounds in the geoscience education and research community. Proposals that will address elements in the following two areas are encouraged: Professional Development . GEO encourages projects that will develop efforts and training that focus on the creation of BAJEDI (Belonging Accessibility Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion) leaders through scaling of model professional development (PD) programs, identifying barriers that exist within academia and/or the geosciences that prevent the development of diversity champions, and the employment of strategies that will create and sustain cohorts of diversity leaders to maximize collective impact in the geoscience ecosystem. Examples of focus areas for PD centered proposals could include: 1) training in BAJEDI for graduate students and postdocs who will soon be on the job market, 2) creation of curriculum and standards for safe, equitable and inclusive education and research practices, 3) development of guidance that would assist geoscience academic and research units in developing or implementing BAJEDI plans, and 4) identification and fostering of practices related to the valuation of BAJEDI leaders and their activities in institutional promotion systems. Geoscience Capacity Building at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) . With the recognition that Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) operate with intentionality and holistic support of students (NASEM 2019), GEO also welcomes proposals that envision new efforts to create educational or degree granting geoscience programs at MSIs or scale existing geoscience programs into graduate programs at MSIs with the following elements in mind: Consideration of the necessary steps to create or scale an educational or degree granting geoscience program through partnerships and collaborations, with an emphasis on collaborative infrastructure as defined under the NSF INCLUDES Program. Development of pilot bridge programs (high school to undergraduate, undergraduate to graduate and graduate to workforce) to grow the pool of potential geoscience program majors at MSIs and prepare them to be geoscience professionals. Identification and reduction of barriers (e.g., grants infrastructure or institutional policies) that may hinder the creation and sustainability of educational and degree granting geoscience programs at MSIs. Creation of a coordinating unit to assist in supporting or building grants management infrastructure at MSIs. When developing proposals, the PI team should acknowledge the need for increased engagement from social and behavioral science experts to address issues related to BAJEDI in the geosciences and include these best practices and experts in proposed projects. Proposals could also focus on the dissemination of information on lessons learned from related activities (e.g., GOLD, NSF INCLUDES National Network, etc.) to the geoscience community, and encourage new opportunities for collaboration in the community and across other NSF Broadening Participation Programs .

In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements.

Environmental engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies chemical, biological, and physical scientific principles to protect human and ecological health.


The goal of the Environmental Engineering program is tosupport potentially transformative fundamental research that applies scientific and engineering principles to 1) prevent, minimize, or re-use solid, liquid, and gaseous discharges of pollution to soil, water, and air by closing resource loops or through other measures; 2) mitigate the ecological and human-health impacts of such releases by smart/adaptive/reactive amendments or manipulation of the environment, and 3) remediate polluted environments through engineered chemical, biological, and/or geo-physical processes.


Integral to achieving these goals is a fundamental understanding of the transport and biogeochemical reactivity of pollutants in the environment. Therefore, research on environmental micro/biology, environmental chemistry, and environmental geophysics may be relevant providing the research has a clear objective of protecting human and ecological health.


Major areas of interest include (but are not limited to): Building afuture without pollution or waste: Investigation of innovative biogeochemical processes that prevent or minimize the production of waste; waste valorization and other research that will lead to new technologies toextract resources from waste streams to close the resource loop. Sustainable supply and protection ofwater: Investigation of innovative biogeochemical processesthat remove, biologically or chemically transform, and/or prevent therelease of contaminants in surface and groundwater; innovative processesfor recovery of water, nutrients, and other resources from wastewater,saline water, or brines; innovative approaches to smart and adaptive management of surface water, groundwater, and urban watersheds and storm water to maintain/improve quality and prevent downstream impacts from nutrients and other water constituents. Environmentalchemistry, fate, and transport of nutrients and contaminants of emergingconcern in air, water, soils, and sediments:Investigation of transport and biogeochemical reactivity in theenvironment; environmental forensics to identify sources and reaction pathways; field- and laboratory scale experimental research that bridgesgaps between data and predictions from molecular, continuum, and field-scale modeling. Environmentalengineering of the built environment: Research to understand the biogeochemical reactivity of the builtenvironment with the goal of enhancing and improving human and ecological health; research that will lead to new technologies to improve outdoor and indoor air quality; research to understand how drinking water and wastewater chemical characteristics and microbial community structure impact or are affected by water quality and human health. NOTE: Proposals with a scientific focus on chemical or physical separation processes (for example, materials or processes for reverse osmosis, membrane distillation, and hypo-filtration) should be submitted to the Interfacial Engineering program (CBET 1417). Proposals that seek to advance fundamental and quantitative understanding of the behaviors of nanomaterials and nanosystems should be submitted to the Nanoscale Interactions program (CBET 1179). Proposals focused on in vitro molecular-level environmental chemistry research should be submitted to Environmental Chemical Sciences program (CHE-ECS 6882). Proposals focusing on industrial ecology, green engineering, and ecological/earth systems engineering should be submitted to the Environmental Sustainability program (CBET 7643). Proposals whose main research focus is on materials development, sensors, or environmental monitoring that do not seek to understand biogeochemical reactivity mechanisms or treatment efficiency are not encouraged and may be returned without review.


Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the PI contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.


INFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS


Proposals should address the novelty and/or potentially transformative nature of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field. Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research. The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.


The duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of PI time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the “What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)” link towards the bottom of this page.


Faculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged. Award duration is five years. The submission deadline for Engineering CAREER proposals is in July every year. Learn more in the CAREER program description .


Proposals for Conferences, Workshops, and Supplements: PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss their requests with the program director before submission of the proposal.


Grants forRapid Response Research(RAPID)andEArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research(EAGER)are also considered when appropriate.Please note that proposals of these types must be discussed with the program director before submission.Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)proposals that integrate fundamental research with translational results and are consistent with the application areas of interest to each program are also encouraged.Please note that RAPID, EAGER, and GOALI proposals can be submitted anytime during the year. Details about RAPID, EAGER, and GOALI are available in the Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide(PAPPG), Part 1, Chapter II, Section E: Types of Proposals .

  -
Track 1:


Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) - Two- and four-year IHEs (including community colleges) accredited in, and having a campus located in the US, acting on behalf of their faculty members. Special Instructions for International Branch Campuses of US IHEs: If the proposal includes funding to be provided to an international branch campus of a US institution of higher education (including through use of subawards and consultant arrangements), the proposer must explain the benefit(s) to the project of performance at the international branch campus, and justify why the project activities cannot be performed at the US campus.


Non-profit, non-academic organizations: Independent museums, observatories, research labs, professional societies and similar organizations in the U.S. associated with educational or research activities.


Track 2 and FORECAST Planning Grants:


Master&rsquo;s degree-granting Emerging Research Institutions (defined in 42 &sect;USC 18901 as institutions of higher education with an established undergraduate or graduate program that have less than $50,000,000 in Federal research expenditures) that award degrees in STEM disciplines supported by NSF and that are accredited in, and have a campus located in the US. Information from NSF 24-308, the Higher Education Research and Development (HERD) Survey <span>(</span><span>Table 24. Federally financed higher education R&amp;D expenditures, ranked by FY 2022 R&amp;D expenditures: FYs 2010&ndash;22)</span>will be used to determine institutional eligibility (<span><a href=""https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf24308/"">https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf24308/</a></span>). Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: Focus On Recruiting Emerging Climate and Adaptation Scientists and Transformers (FORECAST) seeks to facilitate the transition from status quo graduate career preparation to a student-centered model with a particular emphasis on building entrepreneurial and innovation capacity at emerging research institutions (ERIs). Transformers are scientists ready to tackle the challenges the nation and world are facing due to climate change. This opportunity will adopt the spirit of multiple directives for the research community; for example, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report on Earth System Science and the Advisory Committee for Environmental Research and Education report on Engaged Research . These directives call on the research enterprise to support the building of a robust scientific workforce ready to work with communities in addressing societal challenges. Through convergence research approaches to address societal challenges, the transdisciplinary researchers engaged in FORECAST will foster community resilience and the translation of research outcomes for societal benefits, as well as gain a broader understanding of the governmental context related to these issues. A new generation of scientists trained in ""engaged research"" will be expected to have a national impact in communities that may be disproportionately affected by climate change impacts. The program will build cohorts of innovative scholars from the full spectrum of diverse talent at emerging research institutions to include groups historically excluded in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Participants, who are senior students in undergraduate programs and students who are in master's degree programs, will be supported through intentional professional development activities. FORECAST participants must be US citizens or permanent residents.


FORECAST proposals will fall into three categories: Track 1, Track 2, and FORECAST Planning grants. Track 1 will support one Coordination Hub, to coordinate support for rising seniors from emerging research institutions (ERIs) or historically excluded and underserved groups as part of a national cohort to participate in structured professional development opportunities. Track 2 projects will support cohorts of Master's degree students at ERIs. Mentorship and capacity building should be central to the cohort approach. FORECAST Planning grant proposals will build capacity at ERI institutions and with the appropriate partners to undertake the activities necessary to establish a future FORECAST track 2 cohort.

PLEASE NOTE: this program has MANDATORY Notices of Intent, which are due via NSPIRES by August 22, 2024. See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list .

Archive Date: Dec 04, 2026 Estimated Total Program Funding: $ 29,000,000 Award Ceiling: $3,000,000 Award Floor: $300,000 Eligibility Eligible Applicants: Others (see text field entitled ""Additional Information on Eligibility"" for clarification) Additional Information on Eligibility: *Who May Submit Proposals: Proposals may only be submitted by the following:
  -
Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs): Non-profit two- and four-year IHEs (including community colleges) accredited in, and having a campus located in the U.S., acting on behalf of their faculty members. Special Instructions for International Branch Campuses of U.S. IHEs: If the proposal includes funding to be provided to an international branch campus of a U.S. institution of higher education (including through use of subawards and consultant arrangements), the proposer must explain the benefit(s) to the project of performance at the international branch campus and justify why the project activities cannot be performed at the U.S. campus.


Non-profit, Non-academic Organizations: Independent museums, observatories, research laboratories, professional societies and similar organizations located in the U.S. that are directly associated with educational or research activities. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The NSF ADVANCE program contributes to the National Science Foundation's goal of a more diverse and capable science and engineering workforce. 1 In this solicitation, the NSF ADVANCE program seeks to build on prior NSF ADVANCE work and other research and literature concerning gender, racial, and ethnic equity. The NSF ADVANCE program goal is to broaden the implementation of evidence-based systemic change strategies that promote equity for STEM 2 faculty in academic workplaces and the academic profession. The NSF ADVANCE program provides grants to enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and to mitigate the systemic factors that create inequities in the academic profession and workplaces. Systemic (or organizational) inequities may exist in areas such as policy and practice as well as in organizational culture and climate. For example, practices in academic departments that result in the inequitable allocation of service or teaching assignments may impede research productivity, delay advancement, and create a culture of differential treatment and rewards. Similarly, policies and procedures that do not mitigate implicit bias in hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions could lead to women and racial and ethnic minorities being evaluated less favorably, perpetuating historical under-participation in STEM academic careers and contributing to an academic climate that is not inclusive.


All NSF ADVANCE proposals are expected to use intersectional approaches in the design of systemic change strategies in recognition that gender, race and ethnicity do not exist in isolation from each other and from other categories of social identity. The solicitation includes four funding tracks: Institutional Transformation (IT), Adaptation, Partnership, and Catalyst, in support of the NSF ADVANCE program goal to broaden the implementation of systemic strategies that promote equity for STEM faculty in academic workplaces and the academic profession. The Institutional Transformation (IT) track is designed to support the development, implementation, and evaluation of innovative systemic change strategies that promote gender equity for STEM faculty within an institution of higher education. The Adaptation track is designed to support the work to adapt, implement, and evaluate evidence-based systemic change strategies that have been shown to promote gender equity for STEM faculty in academic workplaces and the academic profession. Adaptation projects can either: 1) support the adaptation of evidence-based systemic change strategies to promote equity for STEM faculty within an institution of higher education; or 2) facilitate national or regional STEM disciplinary transformation by adapting evidence-based systemic change strategies to non-profit, non-academic organizations. The Partnership track is designed to support the work to facilitate the broader adaptation of gender equity and systemic change strategies. Partnership projects are expected to result in national or regional transformation in STEM academic workplaces and the academic profession and demonstrate significant reach. Partnership projects can focus on the transformation of institutions and organizations and/or the transformation within one or more STEM disciplines. The Catalyst track is designed to broaden the types of IHEs that are able to undertake data collection and institutional self-assessment work to identify systemic gender inequities impacting their STEM faculty so that these can be addressed by the institution. Please note that NSF ADVANCE does not provide fellowships, research, or travel grants to individual students, postdoctoral researchers, or faculty to pursue STEM degrees or research. Undergraduate STEM opportunities can be found at stemundergrads.science.gov and graduate STEM opportunities at stemgradstudents.science.gov .

Organizations outside the U.S. that propose on the basis of a policy of no-exchange-of-funds; consult the NASA Proposer’s Guide (https://www.nasa.gov/general/grants-policy-and-compliance-team/ - section-2) for specific details. Some NRAs may be issued jointly with a non-U.S. organization, e.g., those concerning guest observing programs for jointly sponsored space science programs, that will contain additional special guidelines for non-U.S. participants. Also reference the Proposer’s Guide for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested. Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list . Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/ , and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Organizations outside the U.S. that propose on the basis of a policy of no-exchange-of-funds; consult the NASA Proposer’s Guide (https://www.nasa.gov/general/grants-policy-and-compliance-team/ - section-2) for specific details. Some NRAs may be issued jointly with a non-U.S. organization, e.g., those concerning guest observing programs for jointly sponsored space science programs, that will contain additional special guidelines for non-U.S. participants. Also reference the Proposer’s Guide for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested. Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: PLEASE NOTE: this program has MANDATORY Notices of Intent, which are due via NSPIRES by January 23, 2024. See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list . Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/ , and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list .

Organizations outside the U.S. that propose on the basis of a policy of no-exchange-of-funds; consult the NASA Proposer’s Guide (https://www.nasa.gov/general/grants-policy-and-compliance-team/ - section-2) for specific details. Some NRAs may be issued jointly with a non-U.S. organization, e.g., those concerning guest observing programs for jointly sponsored space science programs, that will contain additional special guidelines for non-U.S. participants. Also reference the Proposer’s Guide for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested. Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: PLEASE NOTE: this program has MANDATORY Notices of Intent, which are due via NSPIRES by November 26, 2024. See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 .

Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: Please note that this program requests optional Notices of Intent, which are due via NSPIRES by August 30, 2024. See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list . Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/ , and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

  -Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) - Two- and four-year IHEs (including community colleges) accredited in, and having a campus located in the US, acting
     on behalf of their faculty members.Special Instructions for International Branch Campuses of US IHEs: If the proposal includes funding to be provided to an
     international branch campus of a US institution of higher education (including through use of subawards and consultant arrangements), the proposer must explain
     the benefit(s) to the project of performance at the international branch campus, and justify why the project activities cannot be performed at the US campus. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program contributes to the National Science Foundation's objective to foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce. 1 Through this solicitation, the NSF seeks to build on prior AGEP work, and other research and literature concerning racial and ethnic equity, in order to address the AGEP program goal to increase the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty in STEM. 2 Furthering the AGEP goal requires advancing knowledge about new academic STEM career pathway models, and about evidence-based systemic or institutional change initiatives to promote equity and the professional advancement of the AGEP populations who are pursuing, entering and continuing in non-tenure and tenure-track STEM faculty positions. The use of the term ""historically underrepresented minority"" reflects language from Congress, and in the context of the AGEP program, the AGEP populations are defined as STEM doctoral candidates, postdoctoral scholars and faculty, who are African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The terms for these racial and ethnic populations are derived from the US government's guidance for federal statistics and administrative reporting. At the graduate student level, only doctoral candidates are included because they have greater potential to enter a faculty position within the project duration time frame. Improving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty, educating America’s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, seeks to fund grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace. The AGEP program goal to increase the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty is bolstered by the National Science Board’s Vision 2030: Vision for the Future . 3 Systemic and organizational inequities may exist in areas such as policy and practice as well as in institutional, departmental, laboratory and classroom culture and climate. AGEP proposals may address, for example, practices in academic departments that result in the inequitable allocation of service or teaching assignments which may impede research productivity, delay career advancement, and create a culture of differential treatment and rewards. Similarly, policies and procedures that fail to mitigate implicit bias in hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions could lead to people who are members of AGEP populations being evaluated less favorably, perpetuating historical under-participation in STEM academic careers and contributing to an academic climate that is not inclusive.


All AGEP Alliances are expected to engage similar institutions of higher education (IHE) to work collaboratively and use intersectional approaches in the design, implementation, and evaluation of systemic change strategies. The collaborating IHEs must be similar to each other based on such variables as Carnegie classification, geographic location and student and/or faculty demographic characteristics.


This solicitation includes three funding tracks that all support the AGEP program goal. All tracks require collaborative IHE teams to use an intersectional lens as they address systemic and institutional change strategies at IHEs to promote equity for AGEP populations. The AGEP Institutional Transformation Alliance (ITA) track is designed to support the development, implementation, and evaluation of innovative systemic and institutional change strategies that promote equity for AGEP populations, within similar IHEs. ITAs will create permanent policy and practice changes that advance AGEP populations, and the project work is expected to be sustained after NSF funding expires. Please note that a preliminary proposal to the ITA track is required, and that at least one of the institutions submitting must first have or have had an AGEP Catalyst Alliance. The proposing IHEs represented in the preliminary ITA proposal must be the same collaborating IHEs who will plan to submit a full ITA proposal, if invited by NSF to submit the full ITA. Please read the full solicitation for details about ITA Preliminary and Full proposal submissions that begin in FY2022. The AGEP Faculty Career Pathways Alliance Model (FC-PAM) track is intended to support the development, implementation, evaluation, and institutionalization of Alliance models that will advance AGEP populations, within similar IHEs. The FC-PAM collaborators must also self-study into how socio-cultural, economic, structural, leadership and institutional variables affect the formation of the FC-PAM Alliance, and the strategies or interventions the collaborators implement to advance the AGEP populations.A Letter of Intent (LOI) is required ONLY for IHEs that plan to submit an FC-PAM collaborative proposal, and only one LOI is needed for the collaborating research institutions that plan to submit the FC-PAM proposal.The FC-PAM track will only be available in FY2021-FY2022 and it will be discontinued thereafter. The AGEP Catalyst Alliance (ACA) track supports the design and implementation of one or more organizational self-assessment(s) to collect and analyze data that will identify inequities affecting the AGEP populations; pilot equity strategies as appropriate; and develop a five-year equity strategic plan for the AGEP populations. The ACA is meant as a facilitator grant to help similar IHEs generate the foundational work necessary to initiate an ITA project.

Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list .

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs . Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov , but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list . Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/ , and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: NOTICE: Amended October 1, 2024. This amendment announces several changes to the ROSES-24 Summary of Solicitation, mostly because of the update to 2 CFR 200 that takes effect starting today, October 1, 2024. Please see the amended ROSES-24 Summary of Solicitation posted under ""Announcement Documents"" on NSPIRES. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) announces that its annual NASA Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092) has been released on February 14, 2024 . ROSES is an omnibus NRA, with many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. Organizations of every type, domestic and foreign, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Note that it is NASA policy that all research involving non-U.S. organizations will be conducted on the basis of no exchange of funds. This ROSES-2024 NRA will be available on its release or about February 14, 2024, at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 . Tables 2 and 3 of this NRA, which will be posted at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3 , respectively, provide proposal due dates and hypertext links to descriptions of the solicited program elements in the Appendices of this NRA. To learn of additional new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers should subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/ , and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: NOTICE: Amended September 27, 2024. The NURTURE campaign will move to January and February 2027 due to a delay in the completion of the work on the NASA 777 that makes it a suitable platform for airborne campaigns. The budget schedule in Section 5 still holds, as the campaign will be executed in the second year of the funded efforts. Contingencies are being considered for a potential supplemental effort in January 2026, but those are still unconfirmed. It is expected that any additional support needed for January 2026 will be negotiated during the awarding process after selection. Also, the number of anticipated funded efforts in Section 5 has been modified. New text is in bold and deleted text is struck through. The due dates are unchanged. Please note that this program requests optional Notices of Intent, which are due via NSPIRES by October 2, 2024. See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited.

On that page, on the right side under ""Announcement Documents"" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “ C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf) ” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case ""omnibus"" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3 ), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents ( Table 1 ), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 ""Summary of Solicitation"", may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024 .

Agency Overview: 
The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260):
“(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that—
(i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources;
(ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases;
(iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; 
(iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and
(v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and
(B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.”

ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. § 16538. The FOA and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910.
	
ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/.

ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE.  In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology.

ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. 
  
ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.”  Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”)1 should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity).

Program Overview:
The Nuclear Energy Waste Transmutation Optimized Now (NEWTON) program will support the research and development of technologies that enable the transmutation of used nuclear fuel (UNF) to alleviate the impact of storage in permanent disposal facilities. This program seeks to fund the development of novel technologies that increase the overall capacity factor, power output, and efficiency of particle generation systems (including but not limited to proton, neutron, and/or photon), by reducing beam trip magnitude and duration (referred to as loss of beam). Additional technologies will focus on increasing the throughput of transmutation by developing target materials that maximize transmutation rates and are easily processible to remove the transmuted material. 

The United States does not currently have an active facility for the permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel derived from the civilian nuclear sector. Used nuclear fuel comprises several classes of isotopes that could be processed in different ways due to their economic value. Firstly, uranium (U), which comprises greater than 95% of the mass of UNF, can be reprocessed and converted back into fuel for light-water reactors through the addition of small amounts of uranium-235 (U-235). Secondly, plutonium (Pu) and minor actinides (MAs), such as neptunium (Np), americium (Am), and curium (Cm), which together comprise roughly 1.5% of UNF by mass, are produced from nuclear fission. Many of these isotopes are fissionable and could be incorporated into fuels designed for advanced reactor concepts.  Intermediate-lived fission products (ILFPs) including strontium-90 (Sr-90) and caesium-137 (Cs-137) have relatively short half-lives of roughly 30 years and have applications in radioisotope thermoelectric generators for space applications. However, ILFPs are largely destined for permanent disposal in a deep geological repository.  The major long-lived fission products (LLFPs) have half-lives exceeding 200,000 years and have few commercial applications. LLFPS include selenium-79 (Se-79),technetium-99 (Tc-99), tin-126 (Sn-126), iodine-129 (I-129), and caesium-135 (Cs-135). The last class of isotopes are the stable isotopes produced from nuclear fission and resulting decay. These isotopes could be extracted from UNF, but no commercial processing of these have been undertaken.

A deep geological disposal facility for the disposition of UNF in the U.S. has been estimated to cost $96.18 billion over the 150-year lifetime, after which the facility would cease to accept new waste.  This facility would be able to store 70,000 metric tons (MT) of unprocessed UNF, which is insufficient for the existing volume of civilian waste. Densification of the waste can be accomplished through removal of the plutonium, minor actinides, and ILFP components of the UNF. Removal of 99.9% of these components would allow a densification factor of 225, based on current disposal requirements, thus allowing a single repository to store upwards of approximately 16 million MT of UNF.  The LLFPs are responsible for many of the engineered barriers that are required to be built in the repository due to their long half-lives and environmental mobility.  Removal of these LLFPs could decrease the capital expenditure of a permanent geological repository while also improving safety.

Agency Overview:

The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260):
“(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that—
(i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources;
(ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases;
(iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; 
(iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and
(v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and
(B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.”

ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. § 16538. The FOA and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910.
	
ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/.

ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE.  In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology.

ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. 
  
ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.”  Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”)1 should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity).
   
Program Overview:
The Nuclear Energy Waste Transmutation Optimized Now (NEWTON) program will support the research and development of technologies that enable the transmutation of used nuclear fuel (UNF) to alleviate the impact of storage in permanent disposal facilities. This program seeks to fund the development of novel technologies that increase the overall capacity factor, power output, and efficiency of particle generation systems (including but not limited to proton, neutron, and/or photon), by reducing beam trip magnitude and duration (referred to as loss of beam). Additional technologies will focus on increasing the throughput of transmutation by developing target materials that maximize transmutation rates and are easily processible to remove the transmuted material. 

The United States does not currently have an active facility for the permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel derived from the civilian nuclear sector. Used nuclear fuel comprises several classes of isotopes that could be processed in different ways due to their economic value. Firstly, uranium (U), which comprises greater than 95% of the mass of UNF, can be reprocessed and converted back into fuel for light-water reactors through the addition of small amounts of uranium-235 (U-235). Secondly, plutonium (Pu) and minor actinides (MAs), such as neptunium (Np), americium (Am), and curium (Cm), which together comprise roughly 1.5% of UNF by mass, are produced from nuclear fission. Many of these isotopes are fissionable and could be incorporated into fuels designed for advanced reactor concepts.  Intermediate-lived fission products (ILFPs) including strontium-90 (Sr-90) and caesium-137 (Cs-137) have relatively short half-lives of roughly 30 years and have applications in radioisotope thermoelectric generators for space applications. However, ILFPs are largely destined for permanent disposal in a deep geological repository.  The major long-lived fission products (LLFPs) have half-lives exceeding 200,000 years and have few commercial applications. LLFPS include selenium-79 (Se-79), technetium-99 (Tc-99), tin-126 (Sn-126), iodine-129 (I-129), and caesium-135 (Cs-135). The last class of isotopes are the stable isotopes produced from nuclear fission and resulting decay. These isotopes could be extracted from UNF, but no commercial processing of these have been undertaken.

A deep geological disposal facility for the disposition of UNF in the U.S. has been estimated to cost $96.18 billion over the 150-year lifetime, after which the facility would cease to accept new waste.  This facility would be able to store 70,000 metric tons (MT) of unprocessed UNF, which is insufficient for the existing volume of civilian waste. Densification of the waste can be accomplished through removal of the plutonium, minor actinides, and ILFP components of the UNF. Removal of 99.9% of these components would allow a densification factor of 225, based on current disposal requirements, thus allowing a single repository to store upwards of approximately 16 million MT of UNF.  The LLFPs are responsible for many of the engineered barriers that are required to be built in the repository due to their long half-lives and environmental mobility.  Removal of these LLFPs could decrease the capital expenditure of a permanent geological repository while also improving safety.

Program Overview:
The energy transition towards net-zero by 2050  demands an unprecedented level of innovation that must be completed in the span of a generation. Global primary energy usage has increased continuously for the past century. This increase is expected to continue with improved standards of living and the rapid expansion of new technologies with high levels of energy-intensive computation, such as artificial intelligence. 

Present grid capacity is constrained and cannot accommodate these increasing primary energy needs to reliably deliver power on demand.  Meanwhile, all paths through the energy transition require concurrent efforts to decouple the production of essential carbon-based materials from harmful greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 

Since the Agency’s inception, the ARPA-E OPEN program has served as an opportunity to advance transformative energy breakthroughs in critical areas that fall outside the scope of its technology-focused programs. Vision OPEN challenges the research community to develop groundbreaking technologies to enable a future energy landscape that is dramatically different.

The Vision includes three goals that are critical to achieve a sustainable energy and carbon transition with:

1)	GHG-free  abundant primary energy;
2)	An intermodal energy superhighway that transports diversified forms of primary energy; and
3)	A carbon transition that sustainably meets demand for polymers and other materials.

Additional Information Agency Name: Dept of the Army -- Materiel Command Description: The purpose of this combined Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 35 and Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under 2 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 200.204 (henceforth referred to as “BAA”) is to solicit research proposals for submission to the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Army Research Laboratory (ARL) for funding consideration. Prior to this announcement, ARL announced two separate BAAs to support the mission: 1) W911NF-17-S-0002 titled “Army Research Laboratory Army Research Office Broad Agency Announcement for Fundamental Research”; and 2) W911NF-17-S-0003 titled “Army Research Laboratory Broad Agency Announcement for Basic and Applied Scientific Research”. This announcement succeeds BAA W911NF-17-S-0002 and BAA W911NF-17-S-0003 combining the opportunities into a single announcement. ARL’s mission as the Army’s foundational research laboratory is to Operationalize Science to ensure overmatch in any future conflict. ARL’s foundational research mission spans basic research (budget activity 6.1) and applied research (budget activity 6.2) as defined by 32 CFR 22.105 but may include advanced technology development (budget activity 6.3) and advanced component development and prototypes (budget activity 6.4) when opportunities arise to directly or indirectly help achieve ARL’s mission. ARL partners across the national security enterprise to deliver fundamentally advantageous change that is rooted in the creation and exploitation of scientific knowledge. This publication constitutes a BAA for awards as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 as well as a merit-based, competitive procedure in accordance with the Department of Defense Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARS) at 32 CFR 22.315(a) and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Other Transaction Guide version 2.0 dated July 2023. This BAA document, and the online list of research topics found on the ARL BAA topics website at https://www.arl.devcom.army.mil/opportunities/arl-baa/ , sets forth ARL’s research topics of interest for whitepapers and proposals. This BAA is issued under FAR 6.102(d)(2), which provides for the competitive selection of basic and applied research proposals, and 10 U.S.C. 4001, 10 U.S.C. 4021, and 10 U.S.C. 4022, which provide the authorities for issuing awards under this announcement for basic and applied research. The definitions of basic and applied research may be found at 32 CFR 22.105. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provision of Public Law 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984” and subsequent amendments.

The scope of this effort and the priorities attached to specific projects are influenced by changes in military and civilian medical science and technology (S&T), operational requirements, military threat assessments, and national defense strategies. Extramural research and development programs play a vital role in the fulfillment of the objectives established by the USAMRDC. General information on the USAMRDC can be obtained at https://mrdc.health.mil/. This BAA is intended to solicit extramural research and development ideas using the authority provided by 10 USC 4001. The BAA is issued under the provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-369), as implemented in FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 and in Department of Defense Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) 22.315. In accordance with FAR 35.016, projects funded under this BAA must be for basic and applied research to support scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on development of a specific system or hardware solution. Research and development funded through this BAA are intended and expected to benefit and inform both military and civilian medical practice and knowledge. This BAA utilizes competitive procedures in accordance with 10 USC 2302(2)(B) for the selection for award of S&T proposals/applications. For the purposes of this BAA, S&T includes activities involving basic research, applied research, advanced technology development, and, under certain conditions, may include activities involving advanced component development and prototypes. The selection process is highly competitive, and the quantity of meaningful submissions (both pre-proposals/pre-applications and full proposals/applications) received typically exceeds the number of awards that available funding can support. This BAA provides a general description of USAMRDC’s research and development programs, including Research Areas of Interest, evaluation and selection criteria, pre-proposal/ pre-application and full proposal/application preparation instructions, and general administrative information. Specific submission information and additional administrative requirements can be found in the document titled, “General Submission Instructions,” which is available on Grants.gov along with this BAA. The FY23-FY27 USAMRDC BAA is continuously open for a 5-year period, from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2027, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.

Research addressing all types of arthritis is encouraged including but not limited to osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, juvenile arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The ATRP encourages applications that address sex as a biological variable and understudied arthritis types. The ATRP also encourages applicants to consider whether large data sets or existing studies/consortia can be leveraged to maximize the potential impact of proposed studies. Applicants must address how the proposed research may eventually impact patient care and reduce the burden of disease. It is expected that any research findings would benefit Service Members, their Families, Veterans, and the general public. To meet the intent of the award mechanism, applications must specifically address at least one FY24 ATRP FRA focus area, listed in Section II.A.1, above. Important aspects of this award mechanism include: Impact: A key aspect of this award mechanism is impact. The application should explicitly state how outcomes of the proposed research will have a significant impact on the advancement of arthritis research, potential for exploration of novel ideas, and/or patient care practices. The application should clearly indicate how the research addresses the impact of arthritis in the military, which may include its effect on Service Member recruitment, retention, and recovery. Applicants may also choose to include impacts to the Military Health System, which provides health care support to Service Members and their Families (Eligibility | TRICARE). Research Levels: The FY24 ATRP FRA offers funding for two Research Levels (refer to Section II.D.5 Funding Restrictions). Only one Research Level category may be chosen per application. It is the responsibility of the applicant to select the level that aligns with the scope of the proposed research. The Research Level should be selected based on the research scope and not on the amount of the budget. The following are generalized descriptions of the scope of the research appropriate for each level: • Research Level 1: Supports exploratory, high-risk/high-reward research that is in the early stages of idea development. Research must have the potential to yield new avenues of investigation, such as new approaches, new research tools, or new paradigms. Early career investigators are particularly encouraged to apply to this research level. • Research Level 2: Supports the advancement of preclinical research toward clinical translation. Preliminary data are required: Applications must include preliminary and/or published data to support the proposed research project. The included data may originate from other researchers or research conducted by the applicant(s). Applicants must demonstrate logical reasoning for the proposed work. To be competitive, the application must include a sound scientific rationale and a well-formulated, testable hypothesis established through a critical review and analysis of the literature. Advancing Women’s Health Research and Innovation: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health. The ATRP therefore encourages research that addresses how arthritis and arthritis care may affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men. Rigor of Experimental Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. The FY24 ATRP FRA mechanism is intended to support preclinical or animal research and may not be used for clinical research or clinical trials. Applicants seeking funding for a clinical trial or clinical research should consider the FY24 ATRP Clinical Research Award mechanism (Funding Opportunity Number: HT9425FY24ATRPCRA). A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or coinvestigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. The funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304). The anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 ATRP FRA should not exceed $500,000 (Research Level 1) or $750,000 (Research Level 2). Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $2.5M to fund approximately two FRA – Research Level 1 applications and two FRA – Research Level 2 applications. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.

The research project should include a well-formulated, testable hypothesis based on strong scientific rationale and a well-developed and articulated research approach. Personnel on the proposed team should have a strong background in kidney cancer research. The following are significant features of this award mechanism: Research Approach: The scientific rationale and experimental methodology should demonstrate critical understanding and in-depth analysis of kidney cancer. Experimental strategies may be novel or may be based on strong rationale derived from previously published data and/or presented preliminary data. The feasibility of the research design and methods should be well-defined, and a clear plan should be articulated as to how the proposed goals of the project can be achieved. Additionally, resources should be identified, and availability supported through documentation. Identification of potential problems and pitfalls with alternate approaches should be addressed. A statistical analysis plan for the proposed research should be included, if applicable, as well as a power analysis to support the design and sample size. Preliminary Data: Preliminary data are required but need not be in kidney cancer. Preliminary data may include unpublished or published results from the laboratory of the Principal Investigator (PI) or collaborators named on the application and/or data from the published literature relevant to kidney cancer. Innovation: Innovative research may introduce a new paradigm, challenge existing paradigms, look at existing problems from new perspectives, or exhibit other creative qualities. This may include high-risk, potentially high-gain, approaches to kidney cancer research, provided the application demonstrates the potential for significant impact on the field of research, patient care, and/or quality of life. Research that is likely to yield only an incremental advance is not considered innovative. Impact: Proposed research projects should address a central critical issue or question in kidney cancer research or clinical care. High-impact research will, if successful, significantly advance current methods and concepts in at least one of the FY24 KCRP Focus Areas. Personnel: Personnel are considered a crucial element of the FY24 KCRP Idea Development Award. The application should demonstrate the investigators’ experience in kidney cancer through the PI’s background, the research team, and/or through collaboration. Collaborations should be documented. The following are general descriptions, although not all-inclusive, of the scope of research projects that would be appropriate to propose under the current program announcement: • All Applications: Innovative, high-risk/high-reward and/or preclinical research that is supported by preliminary and/or published data. Partnering PI Option: The FY24 KCRP supports collaborative research to bring a new perspective to kidney cancer research and/or facilitate progress in the field by combined efforts. Therefore, the KCRP Idea Development Award mechanism includes a Partnering PI Option, which is structured so that two investigators, each of whom will be designated as a PI and receive a separate award, will work synergistically on a single project. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI will be identified as a Partnering PI. Both PIs should collaborate to develop a synergistic project addressing one or more of the FY24 KCRP Idea Development Award Focus Areas. Applications submitted by a mentor and trainee as Initiating PI and Partnering PI do not meet the intent of the Partnering PI Option. Multidisciplinary and multi-organizational projects are allowed. Initiating and Partnering PIs each have different submission requirements, as described in Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission; however, both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project, including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. It should be clear that both investigators have had an equal level of intellectual input and effort in developing the application. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization. Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and the American public. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research. Research involving human subjects and human anatomical substances is permitted; however, clinical trials are not allowed under this funding opportunity. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. Organizational-Level Emphasis: The following areas of emphasis are broadly applicable to many CDMRP programs, not just the KCRP. Investigators are encouraged to consider addressing these areas in their applications if doing so is appropriate for their line of research and addresses the FY24 KCRP strategic goals and focus areas described in Section II.A.1 and Section II.A.2. Nuclear Medicine: Innovative research involving nuclear medicine and related techniques to support early diagnosis, more effective treatment, and improved health outcomes of active-duty Service Members and their Families is encouraged. Such research could improve diagnostic and targeted treatment capabilities through noninvasive techniques and may drive the development of precision imaging and advanced targeted therapies. Women’s Health: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women's health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health. Metastatic Cancer Task Force: A congressionally mandated Metastatic Cancer Task Force was formed with the purpose of identifying ways to help accelerate clinical and translational research aimed at extending the lives of advanced state and recurrent patients. As a member of the Metastatic Cancer Task Force, the CDMRP encourages applicants to review the recommendations (https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Congressional-Testimonies/2018/ 05/03/Metastatic-Cancer-Research) and submit research ideas to address these recommendations provided they are within the limitations of this funding opportunity and fit within the FY24 KCRP priorities. Rigorous Study Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Military Service Involvement: Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and the American public. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research. The funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304). The anticipated direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 KCRP IDA should not exceed $800,000. The anticipated combined direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 KCRP Idea Development Award – Partnering PI Option will not exceed $1.2M. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $18.56M to fund approximately 13 Idea Development Award applications. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.

Though the RTRP Investigator-Initiated Research Award mechanism supports groundbreaking research, all projects must demonstrate solid scientific rationale with military-relevant utility. Important aspects of this award mechanism include: • Study Design and Feasibility: The proposed study design should be clearly described, rigorous, and support maximal reproducibility and translational feasibility. A statistical plan with appropriate power analysis should be included, as applicable. If a model system is included in the research, it should be appropriate for the study and applicable to VCA. • Impact: The short- and long-term impact of the proposed research should be clearly articulated. Projects must address at least one of the FY24 RTRP Investigator-Initiated Research Award Focus Areas. • Military Relevance: All projects must be responsive to the health care needs of military Service Members and/or Veterans recovering from traumatic injury, and/or their Family members, caregivers, or clinicians, as well as the general public. Collaboration with military researchers and clinicians is encouraged, but not required. • Preliminary Data: Observations that drive a research idea may be derived from laboratory discovery, population-based studies, a clinician’s first-hand knowledge of patients, or anecdotal data. Preliminary and/or published data that are relevant to reconstructive transplantation and support the rationale for the proposed research must be included. Important Note: Leveraging novel findings from solid organ transplant research for testing in a VCA setting is acceptable if the rationale and benefits for doing so are appropriately explained and justified. For example, it should be clear why the anticipated result might be different in VCA, or why it’s important to confirm the result is the same in VCA, or why repeating the study in a VCA setting could lead to new mechanistic insights or a better understanding of unique aspects of VCA. Investigator-Initiated Research Award applications may focus on any phase of research from basic through translational, including preclinical studies in animal models, and clinical research in human subjects or human anatomical substances, as well as correlative studies associated with an existing clinical trial. Advancing Women’s Health Research and Innovation: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health. The RTRP therefore encourages research that addresses how various aspects of reconstructive transplant affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men. Multiple Principal Investigator (PI) Option: The Investigator-Initiated Research Award includes an option for up to four PIs. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI(s) will be identified as Partnering PI(s). All PIs should contribute significantly to the development and execution of the proposed research project. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI(s), refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission. Rigor of Experimental Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Use of Department of Defense (DOD) or VA Resources: Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, the VA, and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and/or their Families. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research. For research involving animals, human subjects, human anatomical substances, or human cadavers, please see to the General Application Instructions, Appendix 6, for more information. Clinical trials are not allowed under this funding opportunity. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.

Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. In-Progress Review: The RTRP holds annual In-Progress Review meetings in a virtual setting as a forum for award performers to present progress updates to the Programmatic Panel and RTRP staff. Award recipients may receive an invitation to present their project at one of these meetings during the period of performance of their award. The funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304). The anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 RTRP Investigator-Initiated Research Award should not exceed $1.0M for single PI applications and $1.5M for applications submitted under the Multiple PI Option. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $4.0M to fund approximately three Investigator-Initiated Research Award applications. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds.

Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. In-Progress Review: The RTRP holds annual In-Progress Review meetings in a virtual setting as a forum for award performers to present progress updates to the Programmatic Panel and RTRP staff. Award recipients may receive an invitation to present their project at one of these meetings during the period of performance of their award. The funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304). The anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 RTRP Advanced Technology Development Award should not exceed $1.0M for single PI applications and $1.5M for applications submitted under the Multiple PI Option. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $3.5M to fund approximately three Advanced Technology Development Award applications. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.

This award supports the development of translational research collaborations between two independent, faculty-level (or equivalent) investigators to address a central problem or question in kidney cancer in a manner that would be less readily achievable through separate efforts. One partner in the collaboration must be a research scientist and the other must be a clinician. It should be clear that both have had equal intellectual input in the design of the research project. Multi-institutional partnerships are encouraged. At least one member of the partnership must have experience either in kidney cancer research or kidney cancer patient care. Inclusion of experts from outside the kidney cancer field is encouraged. A proposed project in which the clinical partner merely supplies tissue samples or access to patients will not meet the intent of this award mechanism. Preliminary data to support the feasibility of the research hypothesis and research approaches are required; however, these data do not necessarily need to be derived from studies of kidney cancer. Observations that drive a research idea may be derived from a laboratory discovery, population-based studies, or a clinician’s firsthand knowledge of patients and anecdotal data. The ultimate goal of translational research is to move a concept or observation forward into clinical application that is relevant to active-duty Service Members, Veterans, and/or the American public. However, members of the partnership should not view translational research as a one-way continuum from bench to bedside. The research plan must involve a reciprocal flow of ideas and information between basic and clinical science (bench to bedside and/or bedside to bench). There should be an intellectual synergistic partnership between the clinic and the laboratory. The success of the project must be supported by the unique skills and contributions of each partner. The proposed study must include clearly stated plans for interactions between the Principal Investigators (PIs) and institutions involved. The plans must include communication, coordination of research progress and results, and data transfer. Additionally, multi-institutional applications must provide an intellectual property plan to resolve potential intellectual and material property issues and to remove institutional barriers that might interfere with achieving high levels of cooperation to ensure the successful completion of this award. The following are significant features of this award mechanism: The Translational Research Partnership Award (TRPA) requires two or more PIs. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI(s) will be identified as Partnering PI(s). All PIs should contribute significantly to the development and execution of the proposed research project. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Initiating PI and Partnering PI, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission. • Partnership: The success of the project should depend on the unique skills and contributions of each partner. • Translation: The application should provide evidence for the reciprocal transfer of information between basic and clinical science, or vice-versa, in developing and implementing the research plan. Translational research may include correlative studies and/or development of or use of annotated biorepositories. The application should demonstrate how the study will leverage clinical information to address knowledge gaps in resulting outcomes, validate key research findings, expand upon potentially transformative results, and/or investigate novel findings. • Impact: The proposed research should indicate the potential to have a significant impact on kidney cancer research and/or patient care and have the potential to accelerate the movement of promising ideas (in prevention, diagnosis, detection, prognosis, treatment, and/or survivorship) into clinical applications. Clinical trials are not allowed. • Feasibility: The application should demonstrate that the investigators have access to the necessary specimens, data, and/or intervention, as applicable. • Preliminary Data: Unpublished results from the laboratory of the Principal Investigators (PIs) named on the application and/or data from the published literature that are relevant to kidney cancer and the proposed research project are required. Projects including Correlative Studies: The FY24 KCRP Translational Research Partnership Award may support correlative studies that are associated with an ongoing or completed clinical trial. The application should demonstrate access to the necessary specimens and/or data of the proposed cohort. Appropriate access must be confirmed at the time of application submission. See Attachment 11, Letter(s) Confirming Access to Specimens and/or Data. Organizational-Level Emphasis Areas: The following areas of emphasis are broadly applicable to many CDMRP programs, not just the KCRP. Investigators are encouraged to consider addressing these areas in their applications if doing so is appropriate for their line of research, addresses the FY24 KCRP Overarching Strategic Goals and Focus Areas described in Section II.A., and meets the intent of the Translational Research Partnership Award. Nuclear Medicine: Innovative research involving nuclear medicine and related techniques to support early diagnosis, more effective treatment, and improved health outcomes of active-duty Service Members and their Families is encouraged. Such research could improve diagnostic and targeted treatment capabilities through noninvasive techniques and may drive the development of precision imaging and advanced targeted therapies. Women’s Health: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women’s health. Metastatic Cancer Task Force: A congressionally mandated Metastatic Cancer Task Force was formed with the purpose of identifying ways to help accelerate clinical and translational research aimed at extending the lives of advanced state and recurrent patients. As a member of the Metastatic Cancer Task Force, The CDMRP encourages applicants to review the recommendations (https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Congressional-Testimonies/2018/05/03/Metastatic-Cancer-Research) and submit research ideas to address these recommendations provided they are within the limitations of this funding opportunity and fit within the FY24 KCRP priorities. Rigorous Study Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Military Service Involvement: Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and/or their Families. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research. Research involving human subjects and human anatomical substances is permitted; however, clinical trials are not allowed under this funding opportunity. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. The funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304). The anticipated combined direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 KCRP Translational Research Partnership Award should not exceed $800,000. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $7.68M to fund approximately six Translational Research Partnership Award applications. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.

The following entities are eligible and encouraged to participate in this funding opportunity, in conjunction with the Weather Program office: any public or private corporation, partnership, or other association or entity or any State, political subdivision of a State, Tribal government or agency or officer thereof. Non-NOAA federal agencies and their personnel are not permitted to receive federal funding under this competition; however, federal scientists and other employees can serve as uncompensated partners or co-Principal Investigators on applications. Federal labs and offices can also make available specialized expertise, facilities or equipment to applicants but cannot be compensated under this competition for their use, nor can the value of such assets be used as a match. If any applicants requesting funding are ineligible, the application(s) will be rejected without review.To be eligible to apply or receive an award, applicant organizations must complete and maintain three system registrations and access to include: SAM.gov, Grants.gov, and eRA Commons. For each, the complete registration process can take 4 to 6 weeks, so applicants must begin this activity as soon as possible and well before the proposal due date. For more information on how to meet these registration and application submission requirements without errors, we advise all to carefully review relevant eRA Applicant and Grantee Training modules: https://www.commerce.gov/ocio/programs/gems/applicant-and-grantee-training. Additionally, we advise that all applicants carefully read “Additional Application Package Forms” within the “Full Proposal Required Elements” section below.No foreign applicants based outside of the U.S. may request funding.Applicability to Federal Employees and Federal Contractors: Federal employees (hereafter referred to as “federal collaborator(s)”) may serve as co-Principal Investigators (co-PIs) or co-Investigators (co-Is) but their salary costs are ineligible expenses to be covered by awards from this NOFO. NOAA Federal applicants are required to partner with one or more eligible non-federal institution(s) who would submit the application for the competition through Grants.gov per instructions in Section IV.K “Other Submission Requirements.” Eligibility also depends on the statutory authority that permits NOAA to fund the proposed activity. For the purposes of this funding announcement, prospective PIs that are also employed as federal contractors have the same eligibility restrictions as Federal employees.Costs incurred by NOAA federal collaborators are eligible for funding through this NOFO only if they fit into one of the categories listed below. Further details are provided in the attached General Information Sheet.Allowed: NOAA federal collaborator travel is only eligible in critical project-dependent cases. Other allowable expenses include project-critical equipment, indirect costs for NOAA affiliate institutions, infrastructure, and testbed-related costs.NOT Allowed: Conference and workshop travel. Any other direct funding for federal institutions, including employee salaries or other costs not listed as eligible in Section III.A, will not be considered as part of this funding opportunity.All funded investigators must assure and verify, if requested, that they will not be allocated for greater than 100% of their annual employment time should their proposal be selected for funding. NOAA will verify this requirement if the proposal is recommended for funding. Additional Information Agency Name: DOC NOAA - ERA Production Description: NOAA’s Weather Program Office (WPO, wpo.noaa.gov/nofo ) is soliciting proposals for the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBES) grant competition from this funding opportunity notification. The program competition's approximate total award funding per year is $1,500,000.00. Recent societal impacts from hurricanes, floods, snow storms, tornadoes, and wildfires demonstrates that, although there have been considerable advances in weather prediction and forecasting, there is a continual need to understand the intersection of human behavior and meteorology. A variety of social, behavioral, and environmental factors “affect how we prepare for, observe, predict, respond to, and are impacted by weather hazards” ( NASEM, 2018. doi:10.17226/24865 ). Thus, social, behavioral, and economic science (SBES) research plays a critical role in connecting NOAA's weather forecast information and improvements to the public’s growing forecast needs. The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 further recognizes the importance of SBES science integration within the larger weather enterprise by emphasizing the need to improve our understanding of how people (e.g., NWS stakeholders, forecasters, the public) receive, interpret, and respond to warnings and forecasts of weather events that endanger life and property, as well as how to best communicate weather events to various stakeholders. Additionally, the NOAA Science Advisory Board published a report titled Priorities in Weather Research with a recommendation to “Increase investments in social and human behavioral data collection and sciences to better understand how weather products are used and to support co-development of improved products” (p.6 https://sab.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PWR-Report_Final_12-9-21.pdf ). For the purposes of NOAA-funded projects, the maturity of projects is broadly classified using Readiness Levels (RLs), as adopted by NOAA and other federal agencies. The numerical RL scale from 1 to 9 is designed to track project maturity across a progressive spectrum from research to development to demonstration to deployment. Projects appropriate for this competition range from Readiness Level (RL) 2 to RL 8 and have potential to transition to operations at either NOAA or the weather and water enterprise within the next 3 to 7 years. Additional information can be found in the Program Objectives (Section I.A) and Priorities (Section I.B), and definitions of RLs can be found in the WPO FY25 General Information Sheet (herein referred to as the “General Information Sheet”) accompanying this announcement. NOAA, OAR, and WPO encourage applicants and awardees to write their proposals and perform their work in a manner consistent with NOAA’s core values, including those on diversity, inclusion, accessibility, civil rights, and scientific integrity. Promoting diversity and inclusion improves creativity, productivity, and the vitality of the weather and water research community in which WPO engages. Further information can be found at https://www.noaa.gov/organization/inclusion-and-civil-rights/diversity-and-inclusion and https://research.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FinalDraft-OAR-DEI-StrategicPlan-07Sep2021.docx.pdf . Included under the ‘Related Documents’ tab of this announcement are several Information Sheets as well as external forms required to be submitted with proposals. If there is any conflicting information between the NOFO announcement and the attached Information Sheets, then the NOFO announcement takes priority and should be followed over any external attachments.

The KCRP AKCIECSA is not a traditional career development award; the ECS is expected to conduct research, participate in monthly webinars, and annual workshops, and communicate and collaborate with other members of the Academy (other Early-Career Scholars, mentors, Academy Leadership Team) as well as with the kidney cancer advocacy community. The KCRP Academy of Kidney Cancer Investigators – Early-Career Scholar Award supports a unique, interactive virtual academy providing intensive mentoring, national networking, collaborations, and a peer group for junior faculty emerging as potential leaders of kidney cancer research. The overarching goal of the AKCI is to advance kidney cancer research through development of highly productive kidney cancer researchers in a collaborative research and career development environment. The Academy Leadership Team, consisting of Academy Director and Deputy Director, serves as a resource for the ECS and mentors, assessing the progress of the ECS and facilitating communication and collaboration among all of the Early-Career Scholars and Designated Mentors, as well as with research and advocacy communities. In addition to fostering ECS scientific development, the AKCI, through its leadership by the Academy Leadership Team, provides professional and leadership development of the ECS to include skills and competencies needed to fund and manage a productive laboratory or research team. This FY24 program announcement is soliciting Early-Career Scholars and Designated Mentors to join the existing Academy of Kidney Cancer Investigators. This award mechanism enables the ECS (the Scholar named as the Principal Investigator [PI] on the application) to pursue a kidney cancer project that may be basic, translational, and/or clinical research. The Designated Mentor is not required to be at the same institution as the ECS. The KCRP encourages applications from Early-Career Scholars whose ability to commit to conducting kidney cancer research is limited by minimal resources or a lack of resources, such as a qualified Designated Mentor at their institution, access to kidney cancer research tools, opportunities for establishing collaborations, or other obstacles, which should be identified in the application. Preliminary data to support the feasibility of the research applications and approaches are required; however, this data does not necessarily need to be derived from the kidney cancer research field. The ECS must be in the early-career stage. This award provides the ECS with funding, networking and collaborative opportunities, and research experience necessary to develop and sustain a successful, independent career at the forefront of kidney cancer research. This award also provides support and protected time for the ECS for 4 years of intensive research under the guidance of a Designated Mentor experienced in kidney cancer research. Although the AKCI will serve as a conduit to share knowledge and research experience among all Academy members, the ECS and Designated Mentor will be responsible for developing the career development plans of the ECS and for designing and executing the proposed research. The ECS must clearly articulate their commitment to a career as a kidney cancer researcher and to participating in and contributing to the growth of the AKCI. The Designated Mentor must have a strong record of mentoring and training early-career investigators. With the goal to expand and enrich mentorship capacity within the Academy, a Designated Mentor must agree to also serve as a Secondary Mentor to another ECS in the Academy. The Designated Mentor will be limited to one Primary (applicant ECS/mentor pair) and one Secondary Mentorship. Applicants are not permitted to list the Dean of the Academy as a Designated Mentor. The ECS and Designated Mentor are required to attend a biennial multi-day Department of Defense (DOD) KCRP AKCI Workshop and, in alternate years, a 1-day DOD KCRP AKCI Workshop. Organizational-Level Emphasis: The following areas of emphasis are broadly applicable to many CDMRP programs, not just the KCRP. Investigators are encouraged to consider addressing these areas in their applications if doing so is appropriate for their line of research, addresses the FY24 KCRP Overarching Strategic Goals and Focus Areas described in Sections II.A.1 and II.A.2, and meets the intent of the AKCIECSA. Nuclear Medicine: Innovative research involving nuclear medicine and related techniques to support early diagnosis, more effective treatment, and improved health outcomes of active-duty Service Members and their Families is encouraged. Such research could improve diagnostic and targeted treatment capabilities through noninvasive techniques and may drive the development of precision imaging and advanced targeted therapies. Women’s Health: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women’s health. Metastatic Cancer Task Force: A congressionally mandated Metastatic Cancer Task Force was formed with the purpose of identifying ways to help accelerate clinical and translational research aimed at extending the lives of advanced state and recurrent patients. As a member of the Metastatic Cancer Task Force, the CDMRP encourages applicants to review the recommendations (https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Congressional-Testimonies/2018/05/03/ Metastatic-Cancer-Research) and submit research ideas to address these recommendations provided they are within the limitations of this funding opportunity and fit within the FY24 KCRP priorities. Rigorous Study Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Military Service Involvement: Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and/or the American public. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research. Research involving human subjects and human anatomical substances is permitted; however, clinical trials are not allowed under this funding opportunity. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. The funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304). The anticipated direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 KCRP AKCIECSA should not exceed $725,000. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $2.32M to fund approximately two Academy of Kidney Cancer Investigators – Early-Career Scholar Award applications. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.

Research supported by this mechanism is intended to generate clinically useful evidence with potential to optimize patient outcomes and inform clinical care or policy. Research addressing all types of arthritis is encouraged including but not limited to osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, juvenile arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis. The ATRP encourages applications that address sex as a biological variable and understudied arthritis types. The ATRP also encourages applicants to consider whether large data sets or existing studies/consortia can be leveraged to maximize the potential impact of the proposed research. Applicants must address how the proposed research will impact patient care and reduce the burden of disease. It is expected that any research findings would benefit Service Members, Veterans, their Families, and the general public. To meet the intent of the award mechanism, applications must specifically address at least one FY24 ATRP CRA focus area, listed in Section II.A.1, above. Important aspects of this award mechanism include: • Impact: The application should explicitly state how outcomes of the proposed research will have a significant impact on arthritis disease management, patient care, and quality of life. • Military Relevance: The application should clearly describe how the research addresses the impact of arthritis in the military, which may include its effect on Service Member recruitment, retention, and recovery. Applicants may also choose to include impacts to the Military Health System, which provides health care support to Service Members and their Families (Eligibility | TRICARE). • Post-Award Transition Plan: The application should include the plan by which knowledge gained after successful completion of the award will be implemented in guidelines, communicated to relevant stakeholders, or move to the next phase of development. • Clinical Trial (CT) Option: The FY24 ATRP CRA offers a clinical trial option that provides support to accommodate the costs of a clinical trial. Applications proposing only a clinical trial or proposing clinical research that includes a clinical trial within the period of performance may select the Clinical Trial Option. A description of the standard of care and justification of any control groups must be included in the application. Preliminary data are required: Applications to the FY24 ATRP CRA must include preliminary and/or published data to support the proposed research project. Applicants must demonstrate logical reasoning for the proposed work. To be competitive, the application must include a sound scientific rationale and a well-formulated, testable hypothesis established through a critical review and analysis of the literature. Advancing Women’s Health Research and Innovation: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health. The ATRP therefore encourages research that addresses how arthritis and arthritis care may affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men. Rigor of Experimental Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. The FY24 ATRP CRA mechanism is intended to support clinical research or clinical trials and may not be used for preclinical or animal research. Applicants seeking funding for preclinical research or animal research should consider the FY24 ATRP Focused Research Award mechanism (Funding Opportunity Number: HT9425FY24ATRFRA). A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or coinvestigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. The funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304). The anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 ATRP CRA should not exceed $1.5M or $3.0M (Clinical Trial Option). Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $6.0M to fund approximately two Clinical Research Award applications and one Clinical Research Award – Clinical Trial Option application. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government.

These resources may benefit individuals throughout the VCA community, including those who are considering or who have already received reconstructive transplant surgery, as well as caregivers, potential donors and their families, and clinicians. The RTRP recognizes that these resources are not yet deployable products and require further research to ready them for clinical and community use. Proposed studies should expand previously funded qualitative research for the purposes of validating a VCA resource and/or investigating the most appropriate and effective methods and best practices for disseminating and/or implementing the resource. Important Note: This award mechanism is intended to support validation and implementation research, but not the costs of implementation itself. Qualitative research is a form of social inquiry that focuses on understanding how people interpret and make sense of their experiences and the world in which they live. Observations that drive a research idea may be derived from basic discovery, population-based studies, a clinician’s first-hand knowledge of patients, or anecdotal data. Qualitative research is intended to be exploratory, open-ended, and unbiased. The information gathered should be meaningful and culturally appropriate to the participant, unanticipated (not hypothesis-based) by the research team, and rich and explanatory in nature. Implementation science is defined as the scientific study of methods and strategies to adopt and integrate evidence-based health interventions, resources, etc., into clinical and community settings in order to improve patient outcomes and benefit population health. Implementation research may use a variety of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine the most appropriate and effective way to transition interventions, resources, etc., into clinical practice, health policy, or everyday use. The research should be specific to the target population and environment and consider real-world factors and complexities, including an evolving landscape. Important aspects of this award mechanism include: • Qualitative Approach: The research approach should include primarily qualitative methods. Qualitative findings may lead the research in a more quantifiable direction, in which case a mixed methods approach is acceptable. The specific theoretical basis (e.g., interactionism, phenomenology, critical theory) for the study should be stated and should drive the framing of the research problem. • Preliminary data (required): Applications must include an Outcomes Statement (Attachment 9), which is a summary of the research previously funded, and a description of the research accomplishments, outcomes, and resource(s) developed from that award. Applications should provide an explanation of how these accomplishments, outcomes, and resource(s) provide the basis for the proposed research and how expansion of the original research ideas will address one or both of the FY24 RTRP Qualitative Research Focus Areas. • Study Design: The proposed study design, sampling technique, data collection, and recording method(s) should be appropriate to yield trustworthy, credible, robust, and confirmable results. The documentation of procedures, decisions, and rationale for decisions and conclusions should support consistency, dependability, and duplicability of results and prevent biases and preconceptions. The data analysis plan should be consistent with the research problem and theoretical basis for the study, and ongoing feedback from participants should be incorporated throughout the project, especially regarding interpretation of data and study conclusions. It should be clear how the proposed study design will position the resource(s) for the next phase of development or implementation as described in the post-award Implementation Plan (Attachment 10). • Impact: The short- and long-term impact of the proposed research should be clearly articulated. Projects must address one or both of the FY24 RTRP Qualitative Research Focus Areas. • Military Relevance: All projects must be responsive to the health care needs of military Service Members and/or Veterans recovering from traumatic injury, and/or their Family members, caregivers or clinicians, as well as the general public. Collaboration with military researchers and clinicians is encouraged, but not required. Advancing Women’s Health Research and Innovation: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women’s health. The RTRP therefore encourages research that addresses how various aspects of reconstructive transplant affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men. Use of Department of Defense (DOD) or VA Resources: Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, VA, and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and/or their Families. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research. Clinical trials are not allowed under this funding opportunity. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. Clinical research is allowed under this funding opportunity. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. The funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304). The anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 RTRP Qualitative Research Validation and Implementation Award should not exceed $500,000. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $500,000 to fund approximately one Qualitative Research Validation and Implementation Award application. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.

The outcome of research supported by this award should be the generation of robust data that can be used as a foundation for new avenues of scientific investigation. Important aspects of this award mechanism include: • Innovation: The proposed project should be novel and innovative. Innovative research may introduce a new paradigm, challenge existing paradigms, look at existing problems from new perspectives, or exhibit other uniquely creative qualities. If the proposed project is building upon established research performed in solid tissue organs, there must be justification for how the proposed theory is novel. Research that is an incremental advance upon published data or a logical progression of an already established research project is not considered innovative and will not be considered for funding under this award mechanism. Important Note: Leveraging novel findings from solid organ transplant research for testing in a VCA setting is acceptable if the rationale and benefits for doing so are appropriately explained and justified. For example, it should be clear why the anticipated result might be different in VCA, or why it’s important to confirm the result is the same in VCA, or why repeating the study in a VCA setting could lead to new mechanistic insights or a better understanding of unique aspects of VCA. • Hypothesis and Rationale: The proposed research project should include a well-formulated testable hypothesis based on strong scientific rationale and study design. If a model system is included in the research, it should be appropriate for the study and applicable to VCA. • Preliminary Data: Inclusion of preliminary and/or published data that support the scientific rationale or evidence that the proposed work can be completed are required; however, the proposed work should be innovative and untested. • Impact: Applications must address at least one of the FY24 RTRP IDA Focus Areas. The anticipated outcome(s)/product(s), including material and/or knowledge products, should be clearly articulated, as should the anticipated long-term gains from this research trajectory. • Military Relevance: All projects should be responsive to the health care needs of military Service Members and/or Veterans recovering from traumatic injury, and/or their Family members, caregivers, or clinicians, as well as the general public. Collaboration with military researchers and clinicians is encouraged. Advancing Women’s Health Research and Innovation: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health. The RTRP therefore encourages research that addresses how various aspects of reconstructive transplant affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men. Rigor of Experimental Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Use of Department of Defense (DOD) or VA Resources: Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, the VA, and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and/or their Families. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research. For research involving animals, human subjects, human anatomical substances, or human cadavers, please see to the General Application Instructions, Appendix 6, for more information. Because the FY24 RTRP Idea Discovery Award is designed for preliminary investigations, projects involving human subjects or anatomical substances will not be supported unless they are exempt under Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 219, Section 104(d) (32 CFR 219.104[d]) or eligible for expedited review under 32 CFR 219.110 or 21 CFR 56.110. Studies that do not qualify for exempt status or expedited review will be administratively withdrawn and will not be funded. Therefore, clinical trials are not allowed under this funding opportunity. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research is allowed under this funding opportunity. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects.

Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. In-Progress Review: The RTRP holds annual In-Progress Review meetings in a virtual setting as a forum for award performers to present progress updates to the Programmatic Panel and RTRP staff. Award recipients may receive an invitation to present their project at one of these meetings during the period of performance of their award. The funding instrument for awards made under the program announcement will be grants (31 USC 6304). The anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY24 RTRP Idea Discovery Award should not exceed $500,000. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. DOD FY24 Reconstructive Transplant Idea Discovery Award 7 Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025.

Clinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), devices, clinical guidance, and/or emerging approaches and technologies. Proposed projects may range from small proof-of-concept trials (e.g., pilot, first-in-human, phase 0) to demonstrate the feasibility or inform the design of more advanced trials through large-scale trials to determine efficacy in relevant patient populations. Key aspects of the KCRP Clinical Trial Award Mechanism: • Clinical Trial Start Date: The proposed clinical trial is expected to begin no later than 12 months after the award date or 18 months after the award date for studies regulated by the Regulatory Agency. • Preliminary Data Are Required: Inclusion of preliminary data relevant to the proposed clinical trial is required. • Study Population: The application should demonstrate the availability of and access to a suitable patient population that will support a meaningful outcome for the study. The application should include a discussion of how accrual goals will be achieved, as well as the strategy for inclusion of women and minorities in the clinical trial appropriate to the objectives of the study. Studies utilizing human biospecimens or datasets that cannot be linked to a specific individual, gender, ethnicity, or race (typically classified as exempt from Institutional Review Board [IRB] review) are exempt from this requirement. • Intervention Availability: The application should demonstrate the documented availability of and access to the drug/compound, device, and/or other materials needed, as appropriate, for the proposed duration of the study. • Personnel and Environment: The application should demonstrate the study team’s expertise and experience in all aspects of conducting clinical trials, including appropriate statistical analysis, knowledge of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) processes (if applicable), and data management. The application should include a study coordinator(s) who will guide the clinical protocol through the local IRB of record and other federal agency regulatory approval processes, coordinate activities from all sites participating in the trial, and coordinate participant accrual. The application should show strong institutional support and, if applicable, a commitment to serve as the FDA regulatory sponsor, ensuring all sponsor responsibilities described in Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 312, Subpart D (21 CFR 312.D), are fulfilled. • Statistical Analysis and Data Management Plans: The application should include a clearly articulated statistical analysis plan, a power analysis reflecting sample size projections that will answer the objectives of the study, and a data management plan that includes use of an appropriate database to safeguard and maintain the integrity of the data. If required by a Regulatory Agency, the trial must use a 21 CFR 11-compliant database and appropriate data standards. Organizational-Level Emphasis: The following areas of emphasis are broadly applicable to many CDMRP programs, not just the KCRP. Investigators are encouraged to consider addressing these areas in their applications if doing so is appropriate for their line of research and addresses the FY24 KCRP strategic priorities and/focus areas described in Section II.A.1 and Section II.A.2. Nuclear Medicine: Innovative research involving nuclear medicine and related techniques to support early diagnosis, more effective treatment, and improved health outcomes of active-duty Service Members and their Families is encouraged. Such research could improve diagnostic and targeted treatment capabilities through noninvasive techniques and may drive the development of precision imaging and advanced targeted therapies. Women’s Health: CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women’s health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women’s health. Metastatic Cancer Task Force: A congressionally mandated Metastatic Cancer Task Force was formed with the purpose of identifying ways to help accelerate clinical and translational research aimed at extending the lives of advanced state and recurrent patients. As a member of the Metastatic Cancer Task Force, CDMRP encourages applicants to review the recommendations (https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Congressional-Testimonies/2018/05/03/Metastatic-Cancer-Research) and submit research ideas to address these recommendations provided they are within the limitations of this funding opportunity and fit within the FY24 KCRP priorities. Rigorous Study Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of clinical and preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Military Service Involvement: Applications from investigators within the military services and applications involving multidisciplinary collaborations among academia, industry, the military services, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal government agencies are highly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique clinical populations that the collaborators bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing research that is of significance to Service Members, Veterans, and/or their Families. If the proposed research relies on access to unique resources or databases, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed research. Funding from this award mechanism must support a clinical trial. A clinical trial is defined in 45 CFR 46.102 as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. Applicants seeking funding for research that does not meet this definition should consider one of the other FY24 KCRP program announcements being offered. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document_DEC2022.pdf. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, Regulatory Agency refers to the FDA or any relevant international regulatory agency unless otherwise noted. If the proposed clinical trial involves the use of a drug that has not been approved by the relevant Regulatory Agency for the country where the research will be conducted, then submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, or equivalent, that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 312 may be required. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence from the IRB of record or the relevant Regulatory Agency if an IND, or equivalent, is not required. If an IND, or equivalent, is required, the regulatory application must be submitted to the relevant regulatory agency by the Clinical Trial Award application submission deadline. The IND, or equivalent, should be specific for the product and indication to be tested in the proposed clinical trial. For more information on IND applications specifically, the FDA has provided guidance at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application. If the investigational product is a device, then submission of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), or equivalent, application that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 812 may be required. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence if an IDE, or equivalent, is not required. If an IDE, or equivalent, is required, the IDE application, or equivalent, must be submitted to the relevant Regulatory Agency by the Clinical Trial Award application submission deadline. The IDE, or equivalent, should be specific for the device and indication to be tested in the proposed clinical trial.

There is no fee to use FITBIR, and detailed guidance and policies, including a cost estimator tool for budgeting considerations, can be found at https://fitbir.nih.gov. o While there is no direct charge to users of the FITBIR Informatics System, a project estimation tool is available to help estimate costs and manpower needs that may be associated with data submission. Women’s Health: The CDMRP encourages research on health areas and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men, including studies analyzing sex as a biological variable. Such research should relate anticipated project findings to improvements in women's health outcomes and/or advancing knowledge for women's health. Funding from this award mechanism must support a clinical trial and may not be used for animal or preclinical studies. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document_DEC2022.pdf. Key aspects of the DMRDP PTRCTA Mechanism: • Applicability to Section 723 of the FY24 NDAA: The application must propose to address at least one of the two covered conditions (PTSD and/or TBI) and evaluate at least one of the covered psychedelic substances listed in Section II.B. • Clinical Trial Start Date: The proposed clinical trial is expected to begin no later than 6 months after the award date. • Preliminary Data Are Required: Inclusion of preliminary data relevant to the proposed clinical trial is required. • Study Population: Inclusion of active-duty Service Members, which may include members of the reserve components, is required. Study populations other than Service Members will not be supported. While Veterans are an important population, they are not the focus of this funding opportunity. The outcomes of the study are expected to benefit Service Members, Veterans, and the general public. The application should demonstrate the availability of and access to a suitable population of U.S. Service Members that will support a meaningful outcome for the study. The application should include a discussion of how accrual goals will be achieved, as well as the strategy for inclusion of women and minorities in the clinical trial appropriate to the objectives of the study. • Intervention Availability: The application should demonstrate the documented availability of and access to the proposed psychedelic substance and other materials needed, as appropriate, for the proposed duration of the study. • Personnel and Environment: The application should demonstrate the study team’s expertise and experience in all aspects of conducting clinical trials and working with controlled substances, including appropriate statistical analysis, knowledge of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) processes (if applicable), enrolling military populations, and data management. The application should include a study coordinator(s) who will guide the clinical protocol through the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) of record and other federal agency regulatory approval processes, coordinate activities from all sites participating in the trial, and coordinate participant accrual. The application should show strong institutional support and, if applicable, a commitment to serve as the FDA regulatory sponsor, ensuring all sponsor responsibilities described in 21 CFR 312, Subpart D, are fulfilled. • Statistical Analysis and Data Management Plans: The application should include a clearly articulated statistical analysis plan, a power analysis reflecting sample size projections that will answer the objectives of the study, and a data management plan that includes use of an appropriate database to safeguard and maintain the integrity of the data. If required by a Regulatory Agency, the trial must use a 21 CFR 11-compliant database and appropriate data standards. • Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Scheduled Substance Application and Licensure: Applications must be made with the United States Department of Justice DEA for work with controlled substances. The application should document the status of the DEA application and licensure in Attachment 9. Additional information can be found at https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/online_forms_apps.html. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, “Regulatory Agency” refers to the FDA or any relevant international regulatory agency unless otherwise noted. If the proposed clinical trial involves the use of a drug that has not been approved by the relevant Regulatory Agency for the country where the research will be conducted, then submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, or equivalent, that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 312 may be required. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence from the IRB of record or the relevant Regulatory Agency if an IND application, or equivalent, is not required. If an IND application, or equivalent, is required, the regulatory application must be submitted to the relevant Regulatory Agency by the period of performance start date for applications recommended for funding. The IND application, or equivalent, should be specific for the product and indication to be tested in the proposed clinical trial. For more information on IND applications specifically, the FDA has provided guidance at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application.

The NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) encourages applicants and awardees to support the principles of equity and inclusion when writing their proposals and performing their work. Promoting equity and inclusion through community engagement, co-development, and partnership improves creativity, productivity, and the vitality of the coastal management community that OCM supports. NOAA also encourages applicants to propose projects with benefits to tribal, indigenous, and/or underserved communities, and projects that appropriately consider and elevate local or indigenous knowledge in project design, implementation, and evaluation. Applicants should identify if the project is located within tribal, indigenous, and/or underserved communities, and/or whether a portion of the resilience benefits from the proposed work will flow to tribal, indigenous, and/or underserved communities. This program will advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s Justice40 Initiative. Established by Executive Order 14008 on “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,” the Justice40 Initiative has established a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments in climate, clean energy, and other areas will flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment.

The following entities are eligible and encouraged to participate in this funding opportunity, in conjunction with the Weather Program office: any public or private corporation, partnership, or other association or entity or any State, political subdivision of a State, Tribal government or agency or officer thereof. Non-NOAA federal agencies and their personnel are not permitted to receive federal funding under this competition; however, federal scientists and other employees can serve as uncompensated partners or co-Principal Investigators on applications. Federal labs and offices can also make available specialized expertise, facilities or equipment to applicants but cannot be compensated under this competition for their use, nor can the value of such assets be used as a match. If any applicants requesting funding are ineligible, the application(s) will be rejected without review.

To be eligible to apply or receive an award, applicant organizations must complete and maintain three system registrations and access to include: SAM.gov, Grants.gov, and eRA Commons. For each, the complete registration process can take 4 to 6 weeks, so applicants must begin this activity as soon as possible and well before the proposal due date. For more information on how to meet these registration and application submission requirements without errors, we advise all to carefully review relevant eRA Applicant and Grantee Training modules: https://www.commerce.gov/ocio/programs/gems/applicant-and-grantee-training. Additionally, we advise that all applicants carefully read “Additional Application Package Forms” within the “Full Proposal Required Elements” section below.

No foreign applicants based outside of the U.S. may request funding.

Applicability to Federal Employees and Federal Contractors: Federal employees (hereafter referred to as “federal collaborator(s)”) may serve as co-Principal Investigators (co-PIs) or co-Investigators (co-Is) but their salary costs are ineligible expenses to be covered by awards from this NOFO. NOAA Federal applicants are required to partner with one or more eligible non-federal institution(s) who would submit the application for the competition through Grants.gov per instructions in Section IV.K “Other Submission Requirements.” Eligibility also depends on the statutory authority that permits NOAA to fund the proposed activity. For the purposes of this funding announcement, prospective PIs that are also employed as federal contractors have the same eligibility restrictions as Federal employees.

Costs incurred by NOAA federal collaborators are eligible for funding through this NOFO only if they fit into one of the categories listed below. Further details are provided in the attached General Information Sheet.

Allowed: NOAA federal collaborator travel is only eligible in critical project-dependent cases. Other allowable expenses include project-critical equipment, indirect costs for NOAA affiliate institutions, infrastructure, and testbed-related costs.
NOT Allowed: Conference and workshop travel. Any other direct funding for federal institutions, including employee salaries or other costs not listed as eligible in Section III.A, will not be considered as part of this funding opportunity.
All funded investigators must assure and verify, if requested, that they will not be allocated for greater than 100% of their annual employment time should their proposal be selected for funding. NOAA will verify this requirement if the proposal is recommended for funding. Additional Information Agency Name: DOC NOAA - ERA Production Description: NOAA’s Weather Program Office (WPO, wpo.noaa.gov/nofo ) is soliciting proposals for the Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes EXperiment-USA (VORTEX-USA) grant competition from this funding opportunity notification. The program competition's approximate total award funding per year is $2,500,000.00. In alignment with the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-25), this funding opportunity will allow NOAA to support new weather, water, and earth system observing and forecasting applications, including improved analysis techniques, better statistical or dynamic forecast models and techniques, development of calibrated, probabilistic forecasts, and communication of that information to better inform the public. In particular, this NOFO will seek projects that are responsive to the priorities articulated in the Science Advisory Board's 2021 Priorities for Weather Research Report ( h ttps://sab.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PWR-Report_Final_12-9-21.pdf ) as well as the National Weather Service’s strategic priority to advance probabilistic forecasting and decision support services ( https://www.weather.gov/media/wrn/NWS-2023-Strategic-Plan.pdf ). For the purposes of NOAA-funded projects, the maturity of projects is broadly classified using Readiness Levels (RLs), as adopted by NOAA and other federal agencies. The numerical RL scale from 1 to 9 is designed to track project maturity across a progressive spectrum from research to development to demonstration to deployment. Some science priorities in this announcement may target research at a specific maturity level and restrict proposals to specific RL ranges. Additional information can be found in the Program Objectives (Section I.A) and Priorities (Section I.B), and definitions of RLs can be found in the WPO FY25 General Information Sheet (herein referred to as the “General Information Sheet”) accompanying this announcement. NOAA, OAR, and WPO encourage applicants and awardees to write their proposals and perform their work in a manner consistent with NOAA’s core values, including those on diversity, inclusion, accessibility, civil rights, and scientific integrity. Promoting diversity and inclusion improves creativity, productivity, and the vitality of the weather and water research community in which WPO engages. Further information can be found at https://www.noaa.gov/organization/inclusion-and-civil-rights/diversity-and-inclusion and https://research.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FinalDraft-OAR-DEI-StrategicPlan-07Sep2021.docx.pdf . Included under the ‘Related Documents’ tab of this announcement are several Information Sheets as well as external forms required to be submitted with proposals.

Additional Information Agency Name: DOC NOAA - ERA Production Description: NOAA’s Weather Program Office (WPO, wpo.noaa.gov/nofo ) is soliciting proposals for the Observations grant competition from this funding opportunity notification. The program competition's approximate total award funding per year is $2,100,000.00. In alignment with the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-25), this funding opportunity will allow NOAA to support new weather, water, and earth system observing and forecasting applications, including improved analysis techniques, better statistical or dynamic forecast models and techniques, development of calibrated, probabilistic forecasts, and communication of that information to better inform the public. In particular, this NOFO will seek projects that are responsive to the priorities articulated in the Science Advisory Board's 2021 Priorities for Weather Research Report ( https://sab.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PWR-Report_Final_12-9-21.pdf ) as well as the National Weather Service’s strategic priority to advance probabilistic forecasting and decision support services ( https://www.weather.gov/media/wrn/NWS-2023-Strategic-Plan.pdf ). For the purposes of NOAA-funded projects, the maturity of projects is broadly classified using Readiness Levels (RLs), as adopted by NOAA and other federal agencies. The numerical RL scale from 1 to 9 is designed to track project maturity across a progressive spectrum from research to development to demonstration to deployment. Some science priorities in this announcement may target research at a specific maturity level and restrict proposals to specific RL ranges. Additional information can be found in the Program Objectives (Section I.A) and Priorities (Section I.B), and definitions of RLs can be found in the WPO FY25 General Information Sheet (herein referred to as the “General Information Sheet”) accompanying this announcement. NOAA, OAR, and WPO encourage applicants and awardees to write their proposals and perform their work in a manner consistent with NOAA’s core values, including those on diversity, inclusion, accessibility, civil rights, and scientific integrity. Promoting diversity and inclusion improves creativity, productivity, and the vitality of the weather and water research community in which WPO engages. Further information can be found at https://www.noaa.gov/organization/inclusion-and-civil-rights/diversity-and-inclusion and https://research.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FinalDraft-OAR-DEI-StrategicPlan-07Sep2021.docx.pdf . Included under the ‘Related Documents’ tab of this announcement are several Information Sheets as well as external forms required to be submitted with proposals.

Specifically, the awardee will, in partnership with the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and the Strong Cities Network will: 1) facilitate travel by a delegation of Dutch mayors to Washington, D.C. to participate in the U.S. Conference of Mayors’ winter meeting (five days/four nights for up to 10 people) in January 2022; 2) organize a two-day summit on REMVE for mayors from the Netherlands, other European countries, and the United States in fall 2022; and 3) facilitate follow-on site visits and meetings in the Netherlands for U.S. mayors attending the summit (six days/five nights for up to 10 people). The awardee will be asked to arrange a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which manages the Strong Cities Network, to work with them as a sub-awardee (budget estimate: TBD). PROJECT GOALS 1) Raise awareness among local government officials and community leaders about the spread of hateful and intolerant ideologies by racially/ethnically motivated violent extremists, including via propaganda imported from third countries. 2) Encourage local government officials to work with community leaders and national government officials to actively counter hateful and intolerant ideologies. 3) Encourage local government officials to share best practices and lessons learned on countering racially/ethnically motivated violent extremism with counterparts from third countries, including via the Strong Cities Network. BACKGROUND Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) is an essential counterterrorism tool, consisting of a broad spectrum of activities that range from awareness raising about the signs of radicalization and recruitment to more direct actions, including interventions of individuals on the path to violence by parents, educators, mental health professionals, and social workers. Since 2015, the Public Affairs Section (PAS) at U.S. Embassy The Hague has supported exchanges focused on local and community efforts focused on countering violent extremism (CVE). The summit and the corresponding activities outlined in this NOFO are intended to help expand that engagement and encourage cities in the Netherlands and other countries to actively participate in the Strong Cities Network, which the State Department helped create in 2015. From Christchurch to El Paso, violent extremism fueled by hate and intolerance towards religious and ethnic minorities has challenged municipalities across the globe. While cities, towns, and villages have been the staging grounds for a range of targeted violence, they are also highly attuned to the best approaches required to prevent, challenge, and respond to these threats. They also remain the first line of defense to violent extremism, being best placed to identify, raise awareness, and respond to radicalization, recruitment, mobilization, and inspiration. In 2015, the U.S. Department of State partnered with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) to create and launch the Strong Cities Network (SCN). In its first five years, SCN has provided its 150+ members with dozens of training and networking opportunities around the world. To encourage more active participation in SCN by local governments in the Netherlands and other European countries, U.S. Embassy The Hague seeks proposals for organizing a two-day summit in Amsterdam and/or The Hague and other activities in coordination with the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and the Strong Cities Network. The activities will include participants from the Netherlands, other European countries, and the United States with speakers from the United States and Europe. The awardee will be expected to work with all stakeholders to identify relevant local government leaders to participate in the summit and follow-on activities. Priority Region: Europe Participants and Audiences: local government officials from the Netherlands, other European countries to be identified, and the United States B.

Organizations outside the U.S. that propose on the basis of a policy of no-exchange-of-funds; consult the NASA Proposer’s Guide (https://www.nasa.gov/general/grants-policy-and-compliance-team/ - section-2) for specific details. Some NRAs may be issued jointly with a non-U.S. organization, e.g., those concerning guest observing programs for jointly sponsored space science programs, that will contain additional special guidelines for non-U.S. participants. Also reference the Proposer’s Guide for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested. Additional Information Agency Name: NASA Headquarters Description: The goal of the Science Mission Directorate’s (SMD) Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) entitled, “ Topical Workshops, Symposiums, and Conferences (TWSC-24) in Space and Earth Sciences and Technology” , is to contribute to SMD's science, technology, and exploration research goals, such as those described by the NASA 2022 Strategic Plan . TWSC aligns to the 2022 Plan’s Goal Statement: “NASA’s enduring purpose is scientific discovery and exploration for the benefit of the United States and all of humanity. NASA seeks to discover the secrets of the universe, search for life elsewhere, and protect and improve life on Earth and in space. Finding answers to these profound science questions requires support for national priorities in science and exploration, enhancing new opportunities for cross-disciplinary science, and expanding the societal benefits of our science programs.” TWSC award sizes will vary from amounts in the low thousands of dollars—for example to cover travel and registration to a third-party’s event — to $750,000 or more for a large event. TWSC welcomes proposals for large and small meetings, retreats, seminars, symposiums, workshops, or other events, including asynchronous and virtual workshops, etc. The purpose of TWSC events may be 1) to disseminate technical information beyond NASA and SMD; or 2) to facilitate research networks and/or research administration capabilities at entities not previously funded by NASA. Participation is open to U.S. organizations or institutions, including minority serving educational and not-for-profit institutions, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), NASA Centers, and other Government agencies. See the NOFO’s Section 3, for detailed eligibility information. TWSC has no dedicated funding, so proposers are directed to first contact a NASA division, office, or program that may have funding before preparing a proposal . For more details about how to identify and contact possible funders in SMD see Section 7.1. TWSC does not accept Notices of Intent (NOI). Instead, potential proposers must prepare an “Inquiry Email” as described in the NOFO’s Section 4.2.1, and receive an email response from an SMD Program Officer(s), TWSC point of contact, or Division Director prior to submitting a full proposal. TWSC primarily awards grants made under the authority of 2 CFR 200. When NASA and other federal civil servants or employees of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) propose to TWSC, the event that they proposed may be subject to limitations described in Sections 4.14, "" Within NASA, Inter-Agency and NASA-as Primary Sponsor Awards "", and 2.6.1, “Non-Assistance Proposals and Awards and Assistance Awards that Propose Work or Activities by NASA or JPL or Other Federal Entities”. TWSC is authorized by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, P.L. 111-314 and National Space Program 42 U.S.C. §§ 2451-2484 (1976) P.L. 85-568. All interested parties must read the NOFO carefully. All proposals to TWSC must comply with the requirements, constraints, and guidelines contained within the NOFO. Any costs incurred in preparing submissions in response to this email or to the full NOFO are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk .

The Principal Investigator for a Build and Broaden project must either be:

<ul>
<li>A full-time scientist, educator or researcher at an accredited MSI. (For more information, consult the <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/edlite-minorityinst.html"">U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s list of MSIs</a> and contact a Build and Broaden program officer with any questions).</li>
<li>A full-time scientist, educator, or researcher at any eligible non-MSI institution or organization who includes one or more MSI scholar(s) as senior personnel, co-PI or subawardee PI on the proposal. In this case, the PI must clearly demonstrate how they will foster research partnerships or capacity-building at the MSI as a primary goal of the proposed work. Proposals from principal investigators not based at MSIs must clearly demonstrate genuine collaboration and enrichment of the research capacity of the MSI scholar(s). For these proposals, more than 50 percent of the overall project&rsquo;s direct costs must go to the MSI(s).</li>
</ul> Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: Build and Broaden (B2) supports fundamental research and research capacity across disciplines at minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and encourages research collaborations with scholars at MSIs. Growing the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce is a national priority. National forecasts of the impending shortage of workers with science and engineering skills and essential research workers underscore a need to expand opportunities to participate in STEM research ( President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2012 ).


MSIs make considerable contributions to educating and training science leaders for U.S. economic growth and competitiveness. Yet NSF has received comparatively few grant submissions from, or involving, scholars at MSIs. Targeted outreach activities reveal that MSIs have varying degrees of familiarity with funding opportunities within NSF and particularly within the Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) Sciences Directorate. As a result, NSF is limited in its ability to support research and training opportunities in the SBE sciences at these institutions. With its emphasis on broadening participation , Build and Broaden is designed to address this problem. SBE offers Build and Broaden in order to increase proposal submissions, advance research collaborations and networks involving MSI scholars, and support research activities in the SBE sciences at MSIs. Proposals that outline research projects in the SBE sciences that increase students' pursuit of graduate training, enhance PI productivity build research capacity, or cultivate partnerships are especially encouraged to apply.


Proposals are invited from single principal investigators based at MSIs and from multiple co-investigators from groups of MSIs. Principal investigators who are not affiliated with MSIs may submit proposals, but must collaborate with PIs, co-PIs, or senior personnel from MSIs and describe how their project will foster research partnerships or capacity-building with at least one MSI as a primary goal of the proposed work. Proposals may address any scientific and cross-disciplinary areas supported by SBE. These areas include anthropology, archaeology, cognitive neuroscience, decision science, ecological research, economics, geography, linguistics, law and science, organizational behavior, political science, public policy, security and preparedness, psychology, and sociology. To find research areas supported by SBE please visit the SBE programs page or visit the NSF funding and awards page .

Non-domestic (non-U.S.) components of U.S. Organizations are not eligible to apply.  Foreign components, as defined in the NIH Grants Policy Statement, are allowed. Additional Information Agency Name: National Institutes of Health Description: The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to invite research grant applications (R01) for the development and use of current and emerging molecular imaging methods to gain fundamental insights into cancer inflammation in vivo. The motivation for this initiative is that much of current imaging research into the role of inflammation in cancer is largely based on in vitro and ex vivo methods with limited utilization of imaging approaches that could lead to significant new insights relevant to dynamic cancer and inflammation interactions. Utilization of molecular imaging probes in pre-clinical and clinical investigations for precise temporal resolution at the molecular and cellular level are valuable approaches for identification and characterization of in vivo inflammatory cellular physiology in cancers and of molecular changes in response to treatment. This FOA encourages applications that focus on developing integrated imaging approaches to interrogate the role of inflammation in cancer through strong cross-field collaboration between cancer basic science researchers and imaging scientists. These collaborations are expected to advance science and understanding of cancer inflammation interactions.

The program’s objectives are to: (1) build knowledge about how to develop preK-12 students’ and teachers’ STEM content knowledge, practices, and skills; (2) support collaborative partnerships among STEM education researchers, STEM education practitioners and school leaders with the goals of extending relevant scientific literatures while developing more effective practice; and (3) build the field of STEM education by supporting knowledge synthesis, interdisciplinary interactions across fields and stakeholders, and the development of novel and robust ways of assessing teacher and student learning, engagement, and skills. Outcomes of DRK-12 projects can include but are not limited to promising, evidence-based products that can be used by others to support the success of all teachers and all students (e.g., curriculum, teaching and research tools, and models of collaboration). The program solicits proposals along two strands: (1) Learning and (2) Teaching. While these strands certainly overlap and have synergy, proposals should identify one strand that is most consistent with the proposal’s objectives and research questions (e.g., are the project’s methods and outcomes focused primarily on teacher development and teaching or student development and learning?). Research project types under both Strands include exploratory, design and development, impact, implementation, measurement and assessment, and synthesis studies. The program also supports other project types including Partnership Development Grants and Workshops/Conferences.


Successful proposals demonstrate how they build on fundamental research in STEM education and on previous or current applied research and development efforts. They also explain their theoretical and empirical justification (e.g., Why is the project designed as it is?) and outline related specific aims and methods with potential to yield new understandings of STEM teaching and learning contexts, processes, and outcomes. The program welcomes proposals focused on teaching and learning in any STEM field(s) and on priorities identified in the National Science Foundation’s strategic plan . Efforts focused on facilitating the reciprocal exchange or mobilization of knowledge between the research and preK-12 formal education professional communities are strongly encouraged (see this Dear Colleague Letter https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23078/nsf23078.jsp ).

Additional Information Agency Name: National Institutes of Health Description: This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) establishes an accelerated review/award process to support research to understand health outcomes related to an unexpected and/or time-sensitive event (e.g., emergent environmental threat; pandemic; change in local, state, or national policy; natural disaster). Applications in response to this FOA must demonstrate that the research proposed is time-sensitive and must be initiated with minimum delay due to a limited window of opportunity to collect baseline data, answer key research questions, and/or prospectively evaluate a new policy or program. This FOA is intended to support opportunities in which empirical study could only be available through expedited review and funding, necessitating a substantially shorter process than the typical NIH grant review/award cycle. The time from submission to award is expected to occur within 4-5 months. However, administrative requirements and other unforeseen circumstances may delay issuance dates beyond that timeline.

*Who May Serve as PI:

There are no restrictions or limits. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The Civic Innovation Challenge (CIVIC) is a research and action competition that accelerates the transition to practice of foundational research and emerging technologies into communities through civic-engaged research. By addressing priorities at the local scale that are relevant across the US, CIVIC is laying the foundation for a broader and more fluid exchange of research and technology capabilities and civic priorities through joint partnerships involving civic partners and the research community. CIVIC funds projects that pilot state-of-the-art solutions to community challenges over 12 months, following a six-month planning phase, and have the potential for lasting impact in the partnering community as well as the potential to be scaled and implemented in other communities. Additionally, the foundation for CIVIC projects should be rooted in maturing and transitioning state-of-the-art research in disciplines, including but not limited to computer science, engineering, geosciences, biological sciences, and social sciences.


CIVIC is uniquely designed to enable transition to practice of innovations into communities, as follows: (1) CIVIC flips the community-university dynamic, by empowering communities and researchers to jointly identify civic priorities ripe for innovation and to address these priorities as equal partners; (2) CIVIC focuses on research-centered solutions that are ready for piloting in and with communities on a short timescale, where real-world outcomes can be evaluatedwithin 12 months; (3) CIVIC requires a coalition of communities and civic partners and a multi-disciplinary set of researchers to co-create and execute pilot projects; and (4) CIVIC organizes and fosters nationwide “communities of practice” around high-need problem areas that allow for meaningful knowledge sharing and cross-site collaboration during both the pre-development and piloting stages.


For this solicitation, civic partnership and engagement activities, communities, and academic and civic partners must be based in the United States or its protectorates. For purposes of clarity, civic partners may include local, state, or tribal government officials; non-profit representatives; community organizers or advocates; community service providers; and/or others working to improve their communities.


CIVIC is organized as a two-stage competition withtwo tracks centered around the following topic areas: Track A. Climate and Environmental Instability - Building Resilient Communities through Co-Design, Adaption, and Mitigation Track B. Bridging the gap between essential resources and services & community needs. In Stage 1,approximately 35-40 Planning Grant awards will be made – each with a budget of up to $75,000 for six months to undertake planning and team development activities. These include solidifying the team, maturing the project plans, and preparing a well-developed full proposal for submission to Stage 2.Only Stage 1 CIVIC recipients can submit to the CIVIC Stage 2 competition.


In Stage 2,approximately20 Full Awards will be made. These will be selected from Stage 1 award recipients. For Stage 2, proposals will be considered with budgets up to $1,000,000 for up to 12 months. Proposals must describe how the PIs will execute and evaluate their research-centered pilot projects.

To ensure production of new STEM education Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program invests in the Nation's colleges and universities to aid student success to create a new generation of STEM discoverers for the national STEM enterprise. The program takes a comprehensive approach to the STEM Learning Ecosystem to impact STEM student development and retention.


LSAMP is an alliance-based program, whereby a group of institutions of higher education (IHEs) work together to diversify the nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by increasing the number of STEM baccalaureate and graduate degrees awarded to persons from LSAMP populations. LSAMP populations are defined as persons from groups underrepresented in the STEM enterprise: Blacks and African-Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The LSAMP program provides funding to alliances that implement comprehensive, evidence-based, innovative, and sustained strategies that ultimately result in the graduation of well-prepared, highly competitive students from LSAMP populations who pursue graduate studies or careers in STEM, while also supporting knowledge generation, knowledge utilization, assessment of program impacts, dissemination activities and dissemination of scholarly research into the field.


Projects supported by the LSAMP program include:


--Alliance Development Grants (ADG) support the conceptualization and development of new B2B and new SPIO alliances. (New)


--Bridge-to-the-Baccalaureate (B2B) alliances facilitate the successful transfer of students from LSAMP populations to four-year institutions in pursuit of STEM baccalaureate degrees.


--STEM Pathways Implementation-Only (SPIO) alliances are designed for new and reconstituted alliances. These projects focus on building and strengthening strategies and approaches to assist Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) increase STEM baccalaureate degrees to LSAMP populations and facilitate entry into STEM graduate degree programs.


--STEM Pathways Research Alliances (SPRA) are designed for well-established alliances. These projects serve as models of excellence in STEM broadening participation by (1) steadily increasing STEM baccalaureate degrees to LSAMP populations and facilitating entry into STEM graduate degree programs; (2) producing and disseminating new scholarly research on the broadening participation of LSAMP populations (or underrepresented and underserved populations in STEM disciplines and the nation's STEM workforce) and, (3) holistically assess the state of institutionalization and sustainability of the alliance.


--Bridge to STEM Graduate Degrees in National Priorities (BD-Master's) projects support cohorts of six graduate students pursuing a M. S. degree in STEM national priority areas, providing financial support (stipends and cost of education) and support to help develop and maintain academic and research skills that enable participants to successfully persist in STEM graduate degree programs at Master's comprehensive-degree producing institutions only. (New)


--Bridge to STEM Graduate Degrees in National Priorities (BD-Doctoral) projects support cohorts of twelve graduate students pursuing a Ph.D. degree in STEM national priority areas, providing financial support (stipends and cost of education) and support to help develop and maintain academic and research skills that enable participants to successfully persist in STEM doctoral degree programs.


--STEM Networking Incentives and Engagement (NETWORKS) projects provide support to incentivize the creation and participation of LSAMP populations in STEM networks.

The goal of the Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) meta-program is to identify and capitalize on opportunities for major scientific and engineering breakthroughs through new computational and data-analysis approaches and best practices. The CDS&E meta-program supports projects that harness computation and data to advance knowledge and accelerate discovery above and beyond the goals of the participating individual programs. The intellectual drivers may be in an individual discipline or cut across more than one discipline in various Divisions and Directorates. A CDS&E proposal should enable and/or utilize the development and adaptation of advances in research and infrastructure in computational and data science.


The CDS&E meta-program encourages research that pushes the envelope of science and engineering through computation and data, welcoming proposals in any research area supported by the participating divisions. A proposal may address topics that develop or enable interactions among theory, computing, experiment, and observation to achieve progress on hitherto intractable science and engineering problems. Areas of emphasis for CDS&E vary by program. PIs are advised to consult the ""related programs"" links below before submitting.


The CDS&E meta-program is not intended to replace existing programs that support projects involving computation or the analysis of large or complex data sets using established methods. Rather, proposals submitted to the CDS&E meta-program must have a significant component of computational or data science that goes well beyond what would typically be included in these programs.Any proposal submitted to the CDS&E program that is not responsive to this Program Description may be transferred to or reviewed within the context of an individual program. A proposal requesting consideration within the context of CDS&E should begin the title with the identifying acronym ""CDS&E:"". Supplement requests to existing awards may also be considered. A CDS&E proposal should include substantive science, engineering, or computing research. Algorithm and pilot software development supporting science and engineering may also be appropriate, depending on the program. Proposers who seek to implement proven, existing methods into robust cyberinfrastructure are referred instead to the program on Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI).


A CDS&E proposal should be submitted to one of the ""Related Programs"" or Divisions by the associated submission window, deadline, or target date listed in the table below. In picking the most relevant program, PIs are advised to read program descriptions and solicitations carefully and consult with cognizant Program Officers before proposal preparation. Proposal submissions outside the receiving program's scientific scope may be transferred to a different program or returned without review.

     on behalf of their faculty members.Special Instructions for International Branch Campuses of US IHEs: If the proposal includes funding to be provided to an
     international branch campus of a US institution of higher education (including through use of subawards and consultant arrangements), the proposer must explain
     the benefit(s) to the project of performance at the international branch campus, and justify why the project activities cannot be performed at the US campus.
  -Tribal Nations: An American Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges as a federally recognized tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. §§ 5130-5131. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) Program is committed to funding research and practice, with continued focus on investigating a range of informal STEM learning (ISL) experiences and environments that make lifelong learning a reality. This program seeks proposals that center engagement, broadening participation, and belonging, and further the well-being of individuals and communities who have been and continue to be excluded, underserved, or underrepresented in STEM along several dimensions. The current solicitation encourages proposals from institutions and organizations that serve public audiences, and specifically focus on public engagement with and understanding of STEM, including community STEM; public participation in scientific research (PPSR); science communication; intergenerational STEM engagement; and STEM media. Projects funded by AISL should contribute to research and practice that further illuminates informal STEM learning’s role in engagement, broadening participation, and belonging in STEM; personal and educational success in STEM; advancing public engagement in scientific discovery; fostering interest in STEM careers; creating and enhancing the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; improving community vibrancy; and/or enhancing science communication and the public’s engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes. The AISL Program funds five types of projects: (1) Synthesis; (2) Conference; (3) Partnership Development and Planning; (4) Integrating Research and Practice; and (5) Research in Support of Wide-reaching Public Engagement with STEM. NOTES: Activities primarily focused on formal educational systems or outcomes are outside the scope of work supported by this program. AISL does not fund formal elementary, middle, or high school, or undergraduate or graduate education, whether in-person or online. Similarly, AISL does not fund formal workforce training (e.g., professional certifications and degree-earning programs) that is not aimed directly at informal STEM learning professionals. While the language in the Broadening Participation in STEM section draws attention to the diversity of institutions of higher education (IHEs), the AISL program encourages submissions from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer to include those from Non-profit, Non-academic Organizations, and Tribal Nations as core to the program’s Broadening Participation and overall efforts to engage the diverse talent from communities and advance informal STEM education. Non-profit, Non-academic Organizations are directly associated with educational or research activities but do not grant degrees. They include but are not limited to independent museums, observatories, research laboratories, professional societies, and similar organizations located in the U.S. The term “Tribal Nation” means an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges as a federally recognized tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. §§ 5130-5131.

For REU Site proposals, a single individual maybe designated as the Principal Investigator. This individual will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the award. However, one additional person may be designated as Co-Principal Investigator if developing and operating the REU Site would involve such shared responsibility.After a proposal is awarded,some NSF units may allow the addition of more Co-PIs if an exceptional case can be made for why the management of the REU Site must be distributed. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in any of the areas of research funded by the National Science Foundation. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects specifically designed for the REU program. This solicitation features two mechanisms for supporting student research: REU Sites are based on independent proposals to initiate and conduct projects that engage a number of students in research. REU Sites may be based in a single discipline or academic department or may offer interdisciplinary or multi-department research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme. REU Supplements may be included as a component of proposals for new or renewal NSF grants or cooperative agreements or may be requested for ongoing NSF-funded research projects. REU projects with an international dimension are welcome.


Undergraduate student participants in either REU Sites or REU Supplements must be U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals,or U.S. permanent residents.


Students do not apply to NSF to participate in REU activities, and NSF does not select students for the opportunities. Investigators who receive REU awards establish their own process for receiving and reviewing applications and selecting students, and students follow the instructions provided by each REU Site or REU Supplement to apply. (In some cases, investigators pre-select students for REU Supplements.) To identify appropriate REU Sites, students should consult the directory of active REU Sites on the Web at https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.cfm .

Additional Information Agency Name: Administration for Children and Families - OPRE Description: ACF plans to fund Career Pathways Secondary Data Analysis Awards to support rigorous secondary analysis of data collected to evaluate a collection of career pathways programs. Through these awards, the field will better understand the effectiveness of career pathway programs funded by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs that aim to address the employment and self-sufficiency needs of TANF recipients and those eligible for or at risk of TANF receipt. Career pathways programs provide post-secondary education and training organized as a series of manageable steps leading to successively higher credentials and employment opportunities in growing occupations. Programs also provide financial, academic, and non-academic support to help primarily non-traditional students with low incomes enroll and persist in education. Career pathways can offer an efficient and client-centered approach to career and technical education and training by connecting adult basic education, occupational training, postsecondary education, and supportive services.OPRE oversees a robust portfolio of research to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of career pathways programs including the Pathways for Advancing Careers and Education (PACE) project and the evaluation of two rounds of the Health Profession Opportunity Grants (HPOG) Program (more information is available at https://www.acf.hhs.gov/opre/project/career-pathways-research-portfolio). Data from these studies are available for secondary analysis through the Child and Family Data Archive (https://www.childandfamilydataarchive.org). Additional data from the evaluation of the second round of HPOG (HPOG 2.0 National Evaluation) will be made available for secondary analysis on a rolling basis as data collection efforts progress.Award funding depends on the availability and continued interest of the government.

Projects funded by the Social Psychology Program support the NSF mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and to secure the national defense. Proposals considered by the Social Psychology Program must communicate both the intellectual merit of the science and its broader societal impacts.


Proposed research should carry strong potential for creating transformative advances in the basic understanding of human social behavior. Among the many research topics supported are social cognition, attitudes, social and cultural influence, stereotypes, motivation, decision making, group dynamics, aggression, close relationships, social and affective neuroscience, social psychophysiology, emotions, prosocial behavior, health-related behavior, and personality and individual differences. Proposals that develop new theories or methods for understanding social behavior are highly encouraged. Research samples should represent substantial ranges of ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, cultures and other dimensions of human populations. Interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and convergent research approaches are encouraged. Proposals involving non-human animals are considered only if the research offers clear and direct contributions to understanding human social behavior. The program does not fund research that seeks to improve clinical practice as its primary outcome, nor does it consider proposals with disease-related goals, including work on the etiology, diagnosis or treatment of physical or mental disease, abnormality or malfunction in human beings or animals.


In assessing intellectual merit, the Social Psychology Program places highest priority on research that is theoretically grounded, based on empirical observation and validation, and with designs appropriate to the questions asked. In assessing broader impacts , the Social Psychology Program places highest priority on proposals that offer strong potential to benefit society, strengthen our national security interests, improve the quality of life, broaden participation in science, enhance infrastructure for research and education, and include a plan for sharing the results with a wide variety of audiences.


The Social Psychology Program expects the methods, measures and data that result from NSF support to be openly shared with other researchers and the public. For further guidance proposers should consult Data Management for NSF SBE Directorate Proposals and Awards . The Data Management Plan should articulate how the proposed research will engage with best practices of open science. Researchers are expected to engage in open science practices, and deviations from that should be well-justified.


The Social Psychology Program accepts regular research proposals, including Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) proposals, proposals for research in undergraduate institutions (RUI), rapid response research proposals (RAPID) and early-concept grants for exploratory research (EAGER). The program also accepts small conference proposals for events (including workshops) being planned one year or more after submission. The Social Psychology Program does not accept proposals for doctoral dissertation improvement awards.


Investigators are encouraged to contact a Social Psychology program director before submitting a proposal to confirm its fit with the scope and priorities of the Social Psychology Program. Such contact will be most productive by sending a one-page (maximum) summary with an overview of the planned proposal, which includes a description of intellectual merit and broader impacts.


The Social Psychology program is always interested in identifying new reviewers. Potential reviewers should have a Ph.D. in psychology or related field and have a demonstrated area of expertise relevant to social psychology. Individuals interested in reviewing for the program should send a short description of their areas of expertise (2 sentences) and their CV to a Social Psychology program director.

Research areas include syntax, semantics, morphology, phonetics and phonology.


The program encourages projects that are interdisciplinary in methodological or theoretical perspective, and that address questions that cross disciplinary boundaries, such as (but not limited to): What are the psychological processes involved in the production, perception, and comprehension of language? What are the computational properties of language and/or the language processor that make fluent production, incremental comprehension or rapid learning possible? How do the acoustic and physiological properties of speech inform our theories of natural language and/or language processing? What role does human neurobiology play in shaping the various grammatical properties of language? How does language develop in natural learning contexts across the life-span? What social and cultural factors underlie language variation and change? Because NSF's mandate is to support basic research, the Linguistics Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice or applied policy, nor does it support work to develop or assess pedagogical methods or tools for language instruction.


The Linguistics Program accepts proposals for a variety of project types: research proposals from scholars with PhDs or equivalent degrees, proposals for Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (LING-DDRI) awards, and CAREER proposals. We will also consider proposals for conferences. Funding requests for conference support should be submitted in accordance with the Conference Proposals section of Chapter II of NSF's Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) .


NSF's Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS), in partnership with the National Endowment for the Humanities and in collaboration with programs in other NSF Directorates, supports efforts to develop and advance knowledge and infrastructure that will enable the analysis of languages that are both understudied and at risk of falling out of use. In recognition of the critical relevance of these languages to understanding the range and limits of human linguistic and cultural variation, BCS accepts research and dissertation proposals in response to solicitations NSF Dynamic Language Infrastructure - NEH Documenting Endangered Languages (DLI-DEL) and Dynamic Language Infrastructure - Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DLI-DDRI) .

There are no program-specificrestrictions or limits. Additional Information Agency Name: National Science Foundation Description: This funding partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) supports projects to develop and advance knowledge concerning dynamic language infrastructure in the context of endangered human languages — languages that are both understudied and at risk of falling out of use. Made urgent by the imminent loss of roughly half of the approximately 7,000 currently used languages, this effort aims to exploit advances in human-language technology to build computational infrastructure for endangered language research. The program supports projects that contribute to data management and archiving, and to the development of the next generation of researchers. Funding can support fieldwork and other activities relevant to the digital recording, documentation and analysis, and archiving of endangered language data, including the preparation of lexicons, grammars, text samples, and databases. Funding is available in the form of one- to three-year senior research grants and conference proposals. Fellowship support is available through a separate funding opportunity administered by NEH .


Note: a conference proposal should generally be submitted at least a year in advance of the scheduled date of the conference. For additional information about creating and submitting conference proposals, please refer to PAPPG Chapter II. E.9.

The GC advances knowledge of the Sun--Earth system, including how various parts of the system are coupled through dynamical, electrodynamical and chemical processes. The GC supports research on the societal impacts of these processes including space weather and upper atmosphere climate change, with the aim of increasing resilience to such natural hazards. The GC supports research that uses ground-based or space-based observational facilities and instruments as well as data centers and a broad range of theoretical, modeling, observational, data analyses and laboratory activities.

  

  General research topics that are supported by the GC include, but are not limited to: Aeronomy, including studies of wave dynamics, ionization, recombination, chemical reaction, photo emission and transport of energy and momentum within and between the mesosphere, thermosphere and ionosphere of the Earth; how this global system is coupled to the stratosphere below and magnetosphere above; and the plasma physics of phenomena manifested in the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system. Magnetospheric physics, including studies of the magnetosphere, or the cavity carved out of the solar wind by the Earth's magnetic field, its energization by the solar wind and population by solar and ionospheric sources; waves and instabilities in such natural plasmas; the origin of planetary electric fields; the origin of geomagnetic storms and substorms; and the coupling among the radiation belts, magnetosphere, ionosphere and atmosphere. Solar-terrestrial physics, including how energy generation and eruptive processes occur in the solar atmosphere and how energy and momentum are transported within the Sun-Earth system; solar dynamo, solar activity cycle and magnetic flux emergence; eruptive activity including solar flares and coronal mass ejections; solar wind heating, solar energetic particles and interactions with cosmic rays; solar wind/magnetosphere boundary; and helioseismology. Space weather and space climate, including solar or terrestrial drivers of space weather; observations and modeling of the integrative geospace system that could lead to better predictive capabilities of the time-varying space environment; and characterization of space weather impacts on critical infrastructure and technological systems. Proposals to the GC are welcome at any time. However, the following solicitations in support of specific geospace science and community efforts have target dates or deadlines. They also may have PI and/or Institution restrictions. Please refer to the solicitation documents for further details: The Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) targeted research program aims to understand the behavior of the Earth's atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the thermosphere and ionosphere into the exosphere in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry and dynamics on regional and global scales. The Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) targeted research program supports investigations of the physics of the Earth's magnetosphere and the coupling of the magnetosphere to the atmosphere and solar wind, including for making accurate predictions of the geospace environment. The Solar, Heliospheric, and Interplanetary Environment (SHINE) targeted research program supports enhanced understanding of and predictive capabilities for the processes by which energy in the form of magnetic fields and particles are produced by the Sun and/or accelerated in interplanetary space and on the mechanisms by which these fields and particles are transported to the Earth through the inner heliosphere. The Faculty Development in geoSpace Science (FDSS) solicitation integrates topics in geospace science, including solar and space physics and space weather research, into natural sciences, engineering or related departments at U.S. institutions of higher education. The solicitation also stimulates the development of undergraduate or graduate programs or curricula to train the next generation of leaders in geospace science. The Geospace Cluster participates in other AGS, GEO and NSF programs and solicitations including but not limited to: Distributed Array of Small Instruments (DASI) ECosystem for Leading Innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE) AGS encourages and inspires scientific leaders by investing in the atmospheric and geospace sciences, enhancing educational opportunities and experiences and supporting faculty and researchers at all career stages.

Whitepapers and proposals will be evaluated only if they are for fundamental scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the scientific state of the art or increasing basic knowledge and understanding. Whitepapers and proposals focused on specific devices or components are beyond the scope of this BAA. More than one whitepaper and/or proposal is allowable from any single institution or organization.Pursuant to the policy of FAR 35.017 and supplements, selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) may propose under this BAA as allowed by their sponsoring agency and in accordance with their sponsoring agency policy. Additional Information Agency Name: Dept of the Army -- Materiel Command Description: The Energetics Basic Research Center (EBRC) is a basic research program initiated by the Combat Capabilities Development Command/Army Research Laboratory/Army Research Office. It focuses on areas of strategic importance to U.S. national security. It seeks to increase the Army's intellectual capital in energetic materials (EM) and improve its ability to address future challenges. The EBRC brings together universities, research institutions, companies, and individual scholars and supports multidisciplinary and cross-institutional projects addressing specific topic areas determined by the Department of the Army (DA). The EBRC aims to promote research in specific areas of EMs and to promote a candid and constructive relationship between DA and the energetics research community. The future Army is projected to be unable to achieve dominance in range and lethality due to inadequate energetic formulations and form factor limitations associated with current weapon systems. Basic research generates new knowledge that may be exploited to develop and deliver new materials and technologies that contribute to enhanced lethal effects at the system level as well as increased range and a smaller payload. These, in turn, enable space for larger, mission-critical systems, and shorter time-to-target ensuring Army battlefield dominance in Multi-Domain Operations. Army research must encompass new ways to expedite the discovery, design, and scale-up of new materials and concepts which when integrated into newly designed weapons components (e.g. additively manufactured high strength steels with pre-formed fragmentation patterns, and structural reactive materials) developed at ARL and across the Army and DoD communities, will deliver decisive weapons overmatch.

There is no restriction on the place of performance for awards issued under this BAA. Additional Information Agency Name: Dept of the Army -- Materiel Command Description: The U.S. Military Academy at West Point's mission is ""to educate, train, and inspire the Corps of Cadets so that each graduate is a commissioned leader of character committed to the values of Duty, Honor, Country and prepared for a career of professional excellence and service to the Nation as an officer in the United States Army."" The United States Military Academy is located at West Point, New York. USMA executes research to enhance the education of cadets, develop the faculty professionally, and address important issues facing the Army and the Nation. In addition, the Academy conducts research and analysis in emerging fields that may realize novel or vastly improved Army capabilities. At West Point, research is organized and administered through centers and institutes, most of which reside within academic departments. These centers and institutes, affiliated with each other through the Academy Research Council (ARC), coordinated and supported by the Academic Research Division (ARD), provide the infrastructure necessary to tackle the nation’s and the world’s most challenging problems. Our research centers and institutes bring context to the classroom, are central to our vibrant and pioneering faculty, and are one way West Point connects to the Army and to the Nation. Our students are driven, our faculty is world-class, and through our centers, scholars and scientists thrive and produce their best work. Cadets regularly win Best Paper Awards at national and international graduate-level conferences, our faculty hold fellowships and chairmanships in their discipline's national organizations and our products are deployed to the soldier. In addition to applied research, there are centers and institutes at West Point that focus on other aspects of the USMA mission. The USMA BAA identifies topics of interest to the USMA departments, directorates, and research centers and institutes. These groups focus on executing in-house research programs, with a significant emphasis on collaborative research with other organizations. The groups fund a modest amount of extramural research in certain specific areas, and those areas are described in this BAA. The USMA BAA seeks proposals from institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, foreign organizations, foreign public entities, and for-profit organizations (i.e., large and small businesses) for research based on the following campaigns: Socio-Cultural; Information Technology; Ballistics, Weapons, and Protections; Energy and Sustainability; Materials, Measurements, and Facilities; Unmanned Systems and Space; Human Support Systems; and Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Quantum Technologies. Proposals are sought for cutting-edge innovative research that could produce discoveries with a significant impact to enable new and improved Army technologies and related operational capabilities and related technologies. The specific research areas and topics of interest described in this document should be viewed as suggestive, rather than limiting.

To meet the intent of the FY25 DWFP Program Research Award, applications must address at least one of these FY25 DWFP Program Research Areas: bite prevention, vector control, decision support tools or software applications, vector surveillance and identification, and/or vector pathogen diagnostics. The proposed research is expected to be product-driven with a focus on multiple target arthropod genera and/or species, outcomes that are relevant for both military and civilian uses, and a strategy for subsequent registration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as applicable for pesticide end use products.

Additional Information Agency Name: Agency for International Development Description: The New Partnerships Initiative helps the Agency partner with new, nontraditional, and local partners to advance their development goals by elevating local leadership, fostering equity1 and accountability, and mobilizing resources across the Agency’s programs. Six principles guide our perspective on the partnerships that we wish to support: ● Promote local leadership. NPI works with local actors and traditional partners to strengthen local and national systems in ways that advance locally led development. ● Improve equity and inclusivity within partner relationships. NPI proactively seeks opportunities to engage more equitably and increase inclusion in operations and programming, particularly for those communities that traditionally have been overlooked by USAID and other donor agencies—including faith-based organizations, minority-serving institutions, and diaspora communities. ● Demonstrate accountability to constituents. Recognizing that USAID’s work is “from the American people” to the people of the world, NPI emphasizes the need to be equally accountable to the people in the communities in which we work as well as to the American taxpayer. ● Seek innovative approaches. NPI capitalizes on the full marketplace of ideas and solutions by collaborating with partners from all sectors of society, while developing partnerships that foster mutual accountability and develop local capacity. ● Lower barriers to partnerships. NPI identifies processes, norms, and regulations that prohibit potential partnerships and finds ways to mitigate them while maintaining appropriate safeguards on taxpayer resources. ● Identify new and nontraditional sources of funding. NPI fosters partnerships that leverage non-U.S. government funding sources to enhance local ownership and support effective collaboration across the spectrum of humanitarian and development funders.

Additional Information Agency Name: Department of Housing and Urban Development Description: The Initiative for Supportive Housing Development (INSiDE) NOFO targets efforts within Continuum of Care (CoC) geographic areas to address and reduce homelessness by adding new units of permanent supportive housing (PSH) through new construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation through one-time INSiDE awards under the CoC program. PSH is permanent housing in which supportive services are provided to assist individuals and families experiencing homelessness with a disability to live independently. Additionally, no more than 20 percent of an award made under this NOFO, may also be for other eligible CoC Program activities associated with the PSH project, (e.g., supportive services, operating costs, administrative costs (Section IV.G.1 of this NOFO), and no more than 10 percent of an award may be used for project administration.The Continuum of Care (CoC) Program (24 CFR part 578) (the Rule) is designed to promote a community-wide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness; to provide funding for efforts by nonprofit providers, states, Indian Tribes, tribally designated housing entities (as defined in section 4 of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4103) (TDHEs)), and local governments to quickly rehouse homeless individuals, families, persons fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and youth while minimizing the trauma and dislocation caused by homelessness; to promote access to and effective utilization of mainstream programs by homeless individuals and families; and to optimize self-sufficiency among those experiencing homelessness.HUD has the following three goals for this competition:Affirmatively further fair housing by addressing barriers that continue segregation, hinder access to areas of opportunity for protected class groups and vulnerable populations and concentrate affordable housing in under-resources areas.Increase the supply of new permanent supportive housing units within CoC geographic areas to address homelessness for individuals and families experiencing homelessness where one member of the household has a disability.Ensure new permanent supportive housing units are easily accessible to local services; e.g., reliable transportation services, within walking distance.

Additional Information Agency Name: Air Force Academy Description: The USAFA invests in an active research program for three main reasons. First and foremost, research significantly enhances the cadet learning experience. Our research is done by, for and with cadets who work alongside fellow cadets and faculty mentors. Research provides cadets with rich independent learning opportunities as they tackle ill-defined problems and are challenged to apply their knowledge and abilities. Second, our research program provides opportunities essential for faculty development. Research broadens and deepens the experience base of the faculty. This infuses current, relevant, state-of-the-art and cutting-edge applications and examples into the curriculum. This also helps our faculty remain current in their respective fields. Third, at USAFA we strive to conduct research to enhance the ability of the Air Force to perform its mission. There are ongoing research projects spanning topics as diverse as super hypersonics, cyber security, spatial disorientation, athletic performance and homeland defense. This BAA offers a vehicle for research to be performed to satisfy these three objectives, while also meeting research needs of industry counterparts/serve a public purpose. USAFA’s partnerships with non-Government firms enables development in the public arena, stimulating the studies in the greater technical community. All awards issued against this BAA must serve to benefit the objectives identified above.

Applicants must submit a full proposal through Grants.gov (do not submit white papers through Grants.gov, only full proposals) Applicants are encouraged to submit a White Paper in advance of a Full Proposal to minimize the labor and other costs associated with the production of detailed full proposals that have little chance of being selected for funding. Based on an assessment of the white papers, the responsible Research Program Officer will provide informal feedback notification to the prospective awardees to encourage or discourage submission proposals. The Research Program Officer may also, on occasion, provide feedback encouraging re-work to strengthen a proposal. White Papers may be submitted at any time during the open period of this FOA. A separate White Paper is required for each research proposal.

Proposed research can be aligned with TBI, psychological health, or in combination. Clinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), diagnostics, devices, therapies, clinical guidance, behavioral interventions, emerging approaches and technologies, and/or new indications for products currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -cleared. Interventions that are not FDA-regulated (or international equivalent) are within scope but the regulatory status must be documented in Attachment 8, Regulatory Strategy. Proposed projects may range from small proof-of-concept trials (e.g., pilot, first-in-human, phase 0) to demonstrate feasibility or inform the design of more advanced trials through large-scale trials to determine efficacy in relevant patient populations. Funding from this award mechanism must support a clinical trial. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document_DEC2022.pdf. Principal Investigators (PIs) proposing comparative effectiveness, implementation science, health care services research as the primary research objective should consider the FY24 TBIPHRP Health Services Research Award (Funding Opportunity Number HT942524TBIPHRPHSRA). PIs seeking funding for a preclinical research project should consider one of the other FY24 TBPHRP program announcements. Key aspects of the FY24 TBIPHRP CTA: • Clinical Trial Start Date: The proposed clinical trial is expected to begin no later than 6 months after the award date for studies regulated by the Regulatory Agency. • Preliminary data are required: Inclusion of preliminary data relevant to the proposed clinical trial is required. • Community-Based Participatory Research: The application/proposal must include Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approaches in the development and execution of the clinical trial. CBPR approaches should be documented in Attachment 13. • Study Population: The application should demonstrate the availability of and access to a suitable patient population that will support a meaningful outcome for the study. The application should include a discussion of how accrual goals will be achieved, as well as the strategy for inclusion of women and minorities in the clinical trial appropriate to the objectives of the study. Studies utilizing human biospecimens or datasets that cannot be linked to a specific individual, gender, ethnicity, or race (typically classified as exempt from Institutional Review Board [IRB] review) are exempt from this requirement. • Intervention Availability: The application/proposal should demonstrate the documented availability of and access to the drug/compound, device, and/or other materials needed, as appropriate, for the proposed duration of the study. • Personnel and Environment: The application/proposal should demonstrate the study team’s expertise and experience in all aspects of conducting clinical trials, including appropriate statistical analysis, knowledge of Regulatory Agency processes (if applicable), and data management. The application/proposal should include a study coordinator(s) who will guide the clinical protocol through the local IRB of record and other federal agency regulatory approval processes, coordinate activities from all sites participating in the trial, and coordinate participant accrual. The application/proposal should show strong institutional support and, if applicable, a commitment to serve as the regulatory sponsor, ensuring all sponsor responsibilities described in 21 CFR 312, Subpart D, for FDA-regulated studies. • Innovative Clinical Trial Design: When appropriate, the TBIPHRP encourages the use of innovative clinical trial design approaches (e.g., Bayesian, adaptive, clinical bioequivalence, seamless, exploratory/phase 0, basket, stepped wedge) that improve efficiency and ability to determine clinical benefit while maintaining validity, integrity, and ethical considerations. • Precision Medicine Approaches: When appropriate, the TBIPHRP encourages the use of precision medicine approaches. These tailored treatments deliver the right treatment at the right time while considering an individual’s unique characteristics. • Statistical Analysis and Data Management Plans: The application/proposal should include a clearly articulated statistical analysis plan, a power analysis reflecting sample size projections that will answer the objectives of the study, and a data management plan that includes use of an appropriate database to safeguard and maintain the integrity of the data. If required by a Regulatory Agency, the trial must use a 21 CFR 11-compliant database and appropriate data standards. For the purposes of this funding opportunity Regulatory Agency refers to the FDA or any relevant international regulatory agency unless otherwise noted. If the proposed clinical trial involves the use of a drug that has not been approved by the relevant Regulatory Agency for the country where the research will be conducted, then submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, or equivalent, that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 312 may be required. • It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence from the IRB of record or the relevant Regulatory Agency if an IND, or equivalent, is not required. If an IND, or equivalent, is required, the regulatory application must be approved/cleared/authorized or submitted to the relevant Regulatory Agency within the first 60 days of the award. • The investigational drug application, or equivalent, should be specific for the product and indication to be tested in the proposed clinical trial. For more information on FDA IND applications specifically, the FDA has provided guidance at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application. If the investigational product is a device, then submission of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), or equivalent, application that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 812 may be required. • It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence if an IDE, or equivalent, is not required. If an IDE, or equivalent, is required, the IDE application, or equivalent, must be approved/cleared/authorized or submitted to the relevant Regulatory Agency within the first 60 days of the award. • The investigational device application, or equivalent, should be specific for the device and indication to be tested in the proposed clinical trial. For more information on FDA IDE applications specifically, the FDA has provided guidance at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-submissions-selecting-and-preparing-correct-submission/investigational-device-exemption-ide. If the proposed clinical trial of an investigational product will be conducted at international sites, evidence that an application to the relevant national regulatory agency of the host country(ies) has been approved/cleared/authorized or submitted within the first 60 days of the award within Attachment 8, Regulatory Strategy. Research Levels: The following are general descriptions, although not all-inclusive, of the scope of research projects that would be appropriate to propose under the current BAA. Only one Research Level category may be chosen per application. It is the responsibility of the applicant to select the level that aligns with the scope of the proposed research. The Research Level should be selected based on the research scope and not on the amount of the budget. Refer to Section II.D.6, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. • Research Level 1: Research Level 1 is intended to support proof-of-principle pilot studies, phase 0/small phase 1 trials, correlative studies related to an intervention, and other innovative, exploratory clinical trials. The maximum period of performance is 3 years. The application/proposal’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $500,000. ○ Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option: The FY24 TBIPHRP CTA (Research Level 1 only) includes an Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option that is structured to accommodate two PIs, one of whom is an Early-Career Investigator. The combined direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance in the proposals/applications of the Initiating PI and Partnering PI should not exceed $500,000. – The PIs may have experience in similar or disparate scientific disciplines, but each PI is expected to bring distinct contributions to the application/proposal. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for most of the administrative tasks associated with application/proposal submission. The other investigator will be the Partnering PI. At least one of the Initiating or Partnering PIs must be an Early-Career Investigator. – The intent is not to create mentor-mentee arrangement. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project, including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. The application/proposal is expected to describe how the PIs’ unique experience/expertise combined as a partnership will better address the research question, how the unique experience/expertise that each individual brings to the application/proposal is critical for the research strategy and completion of the SOW, and why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts. – If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization(s). For individual DOD FY24 TBIPHRP CTA submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application/proposal Submission. • Research Level 2: Research Level 2 is intended to support phase 1 and more advanced clinical trials for promising interventions. The maximum period of performance is 4 years. The application/proposal’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $2.0M. • Research Level 3: Research Level 3 is intended to support larger-scale clinical trials that demonstrate efficacy in relevant patient populations. The maximum period of performance is 4 years. The application/proposal’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $4.0M. Relevance to Military Health: Relevance to the health care needs of Service Members, their Families, and Veterans is a key feature of this award. Investigators are encouraged to consider the following characteristics as examples of how a project may demonstrate relevance to military health: • Explanation of how the project addresses an aspect of psychological health conditions and/or TBI that has direct relevance to the health and/or readiness of Service Members, their Families, and Veterans. • Description of how the knowledge, information, products, or technologies gained from the proposed research could be implemented in a dual-use capacity to benefit the civilian population and also address a military need. • Use of military or Veteran populations, samples, or datasets in the proposed research, if appropriate. Collaborations between researchers or consultants at military or Veterans organizations and non-military organizations are encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique data and research resources that the partners bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing TBI and psychological health research of significance to Service Members, their Families, and Veterans. A list of websites that may be useful in identifying additional information about ongoing DOD and VA areas of research interest or potential opportunities for collaboration can be found in Appendix 2. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $58.9M to fund approximately 4 Research Level 1, 10 Research Level 2, and 4 Research Level 3 FY24 TBIPHRP CTA proposals/ applications. Funding of applications/proposals received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications/proposals received, the quality and merit of the applications/proposals as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.

Applications from non-Federal and Federal applicants will be competed against each other. Proposals selected for funding from non-Federal applicants will be funded through a grant or cooperative agreement as described above in section II. C. of this notice. Proposals selected for funding from NOAA scientists shall be effected by an intra-agency fund transfer. Proposals selected for funding from a non-NOAA Federal agency will be funded through an inter-agency transfer. PLEASE NOTE: Before non-NOAA Federal applicants may be funded, they must demonstrate that they have legal authority to receive funds from another Federal agency in excess of their appropriation. Because this announcement is not proposing to procure goods or services from applicants, the Economy Act (31 USC 1535) is not an appropriate legal basis. Additional Information Agency Name: DOC NOAA - ERA Production Description: The NOAA Ocean Acidification Program is requesting proposals for collaborative projects that synthesize ocean and coastal acidification information at a regional scale. This announcement specifically addresses priorities for how ocean and coastal acidification - in the context of changing ocean conditions - affects dependent human communities (the human dimensions of ocean and coastal acidification). This includes the identification and engagement of interested partners and groups, the assessment of their needs, and the generation of products and tools that support management, adaptation, and resilience to ocean and coastal acidification. These projects should provide actionable information to decision makers and/or bolster the resilience of the nation’s economy by determining where societal vulnerabilities to ocean and coastal acidification exist or are emerging. This funding opportunity will only support the collection of social science data. Synthesis of existing data in other fields is strongly encouraged. Funding is contingent upon the availability of Fiscal Year 2025 Federal appropriations. Projects funded under this announcement will have a September 1, 2025 start date. Approximately 1–6 projects for up to 3 years in duration are expected to be funded at the level of approximately $100,000 - $400,000 per year per proposal. It is anticipated that a total of up to $3 million may be available in FY25 to support the first year of these projects.

Although Uzbekistan has implemented reforms to boost its anti-money laundering (AML) framework, the country still faces significant challenges in combating money laundering and financial crimes, which threaten the integrity of its financial system, facilitate corruption, and hinder economic development. Despite ongoing efforts, the country continues to grapple with issues related to illicit financial flows, corruption, and weak regulatory frameworks. These challenges are exacerbated by the complex and evolving nature of money laundering schemes, which often exploit gaps in the existing legal and institutional structures. To address these issues, there is a critical need for innovative and effective anti-money laundering (AML) initiatives that can strengthen Uzbekistan’s capacity to detect, prevent, and prosecute financial crimes. This funding opportunity seeks to support projects that enhance regulatory compliance, improve coordination among relevant agencies, and promote the adoption of international best practices in AML. By investing in these efforts, INL aims to bolster Uzbekistan’s financial integrity, strengthen the rule of law, and contribute to a more transparent and resilient economic environment.

Examples of studies appropriate for the PCARP Focused Pilot Award include, but are not limited to: Investigations into behaviors that affect access to health care, Correlations between mental health and/or cancer-related outcomes and quality of life, Strategies to overcome psycho-social issues, Behavioral studies that examine quality of life, decision-making and/or cognitive function research, Development and pilot testing of nutritional or educational interventions, and symptom management. To foster advancement in these understudied areas of research, preliminary data is allowed, but not required. All projects should include a well-formulated, testable hypothesis based on strong scientific rationale. Research supported by this award should strive to produce robust preliminary data that can be used as a foundation for future clinical or real-world research application. Clinical research studies are allowed; however, interventional clinical trials are beyond the scope of this funding mechanism and will not be supported. Basic research and preclinical animal studies do not meet the intent of the Focused Pilot Award mechanism. Principal Investigators (PIs) seeking this funding for this type of research should utilize one of the other FY24 PCARP mechanisms. Significant features of the Focused Pilot Award include: Impact: The proposed research is expected to provide the scientific foundation that will ultimately lead to improved outcomes and quality of life for individuals with pancreatic cancer. The project’s impact on both pancreatic cancer patient-centered research and care should be articulated, even if clinical impact is not an immediate outcome. Innovation: Research deemed innovative may represent a new paradigm, challenge existing paradigms, look at existing problems from new perspectives, or exhibit other highly creative qualities. Research may be innovative in study concept, research methods or technology, or adaptations of existing methods or technologies. Research that represents an incremental advance on previously published work is not considered innovative.

This award supports the development of translational research collaborations between two independent investigators to address a central problem or question in pancreatic cancer in a manner that would be less readily achievable through separate efforts. One partner in the collaboration must function as a research scientist and the other partner as a clinician investigator. It should be clear that both have had equal intellectual input in the design of the research project. Projects involving convergence science partnerships are strongly encouraged. At least one partner must have expertise either in pancreatic cancer research or pancreatic cancer patient care. Inclusion of experts from outside the pancreatic cancer field is encouraged. A proposed project in which the clinical partner merely supplies tissue samples or access to patients will not meet the intent of this award mechanism. Full support for large-scale clinical trials is not expected; retrospective tissue analysis, correlative studies, or small pilot clinical trials are permitted. Significant features of the Translational Research Partnership Award: Partnership: The success of the project should depend on the unique skills and contributions of each partner. Translation: The application should provide evidence for the reciprocal transfer of information between basic and clinical science, or vice versa, in developing and implementing the research plan. Translational research may include correlative studies and/or development of or use of annotated biorepositories. The application should demonstrate how the study will leverage clinical information to address knowledge gaps in resulting outcomes, validate key research findings, expand upon potentially transformative results, and/or investigate novel findings. Impact: The proposed research should indicate the potential to have a significant impact on pancreatic cancer research and/or patient care and have the potential to accelerate the movement of promising ideas (in prevention, diagnosis, detection, prognosis, treatment, and/or survivorship) into clinical applications. Feasibility: The application should demonstrate that the investigators have access to the necessary specimens, data, and/or intervention, as applicable. Preliminary Data: Published and/or unpublished results from the laboratory of the Principal Investigators (PIs) or collaborators named on the application that are relevant to pancreatic cancer and the proposed research project, are required. Preliminary data to support the feasibility of the research hypothesis(es) and research approaches are required; however, these data do not necessarily need to be derived from studies of pancreatic cancer. Observations that drive a research idea may be derived from a laboratory discovery, population-based studies, or a clinician’s firsthand knowledge of patients and anecdotal data. The ultimate goal of translational research is to move a concept or observation forward into clinical application that is relevant to active-duty Service Members, Veterans, other military beneficiaries, and the American public. However, translational research should not be viewed as a one-way continuum from bench to bedside. The research plan must involve a reciprocal flow of ideas and information between basic and clinical science. There should be an intellectual synergistic partnership between the clinic and the laboratory. The success of the project must be supported by the unique skills and contributions of each partner. The proposed study must include clearly stated plans for interactions between the PIs and the institutions involved. The plans must include communication, coordination of research progress and results, and data transfer. Additionally, multi-institutional applications must provide an intellectual property plan to resolve potential intellectual and material property issues and to remove institutional barriers that might interfere with achieving high levels of cooperation to ensure the successful completion of this award. The Translational Research Partnership Award requires two PIs . One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI will be identified as a Partnering PI. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development and execution of the proposed research project. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission.

In addition, there are seven Scholars with active awards from FY22 who would join the VCC under the auspices of the FY24 VCCDA. The VCC will provide intensive mentoring, national networking, collaborative opportunities, and a peer group for Scholars. The Director and Deputy Director (referred to as the VCC Leadership) will catalyze the growth and professional development of the Scholars, promote the cross pollination of different cancer disciplines, assess the progress of the Scholars, and facilitate communication and collaboration among all of the VCC members. The VCC will give the Scholars opportunities to operate in a collegial, highly dynamic, and cutting-edge center to lead cancer research to a new frontier. This FY24 Funding Opportunity is soliciting applications for a Director and Deputy Director to design and implement the VCC. The Director and Deputy Director must be established cancer researchers, be at different institutions, and be in different cancer disciplines along the cancer care spectrum. The VCC Leadership must demonstrate a strong record of mentoring and training early career investigators, a commitment to leadership, and the ability to objectively assess the progress of all of the Scholars in the VCC. It is the intention that through the VCC, collaborations will foster new growth in different cancers and spur and integrated cancer center to ensure the research advancements across different cancer centers. The Virtual Cancer Center Director Award is structured to support two Principal Investigators (PIs). The Director will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The Deputy Director will be identified as the Partnering PI. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development and execution of the VCC. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI(s), refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission . The application should clearly demonstrate that both PIs have equal levels of input on the proposed VCC Leadership and clearly define the components to be addressed by each to continue the success of Scholars. While it is up to the Director and Deputy Director to define their roles, both VCC Leaders should have interactions with the Scholars; acting as administrative support does not fulfill the intent of the Deputy Director. A portion of the total direct budget costs (no more than 15%) must be reserved to support the collaborative “seed projects.” Seed projects should be collaborative projects conceived and proposed by a minimum of two current Scholars. The VCC Leadership will be responsible for developing the intent of the seed projects, the submission requirements, and coordinating and funding a scientific peer review of projects proposed for funding during the period of performance. The PRCRP seeks to promote novel approaches to ending cancer through convergent science cancer research. Convergent science as defined by the National Science Foundation ( https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence/index.jsp ) “is a means of solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and forming novel frameworks to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation.” Convergent science taps into a variety of disciplines to answer the issues in cancer (i.e., prevention, diagnosis/detection, treatment, quality of life, disparities) including but not limited to biomedical sciences, data science, engineering, psychology, and chemistry. Convergent science breaks down the barriers of cancer research and builds a whole answer with tools from different areas of expertise. Investigators applying to the VCCDA are encouraged, but not required, to integrate convergent science in the design of the VCC.

This award mechanism is designed to support innovative ideas with the potential to yield impactful data and new avenues of investigation. Significant features of the Idea Development Award: Impact: The proposed research is expected to make an important and original contribution to advancing the understanding of pancreatic cancer and ultimately lead to improved outcomes for individuals with pancreatic cancer. The project’s impact on both pancreatic cancer research and patient care should be articulated, even if clinical impact is not an immediate outcome. Innovation: Research deemed innovative may represent a new paradigm, challenge existing paradigms, look at existing problems from new perspectives, or exhibit other highly creative qualities. Research may be innovative in study concept, research methods or technology, or adaptations of existing methods or technologies. Research that represents an incremental advance on previously published work is not considered innovative. Personnel: Personnel are considered a crucial element of the FY24 PCARP Idea Development Award. At least one member of the research team should have experience in pancreatic cancer research, as demonstrated by recent publications and funding. Inclusion of a biostatistician in the study team is encouraged. Research must be based on preliminary data: Although the proposed research must have direct relevance to pancreatic cancer, the required preliminary data, which may include unpublished results from the laboratory of the Principal Investigator(s) (PI[s]), research team, or collaborators named on the application, may be from outside the pancreatic cancer research field. Research should also be based on a sound scientific rationale that is established through logical reasoning and critical review and analysis of the literature. Partnering PI Option for Early-Career Investigator: The FY24 Idea Development Award mechanism is offering a higher level of funding for applications that propose to partner an experienced PI (i.e., Initiating PI, who will serve as the mentor) with an Early-Career Investigator (i.e., Partnering PI) wishing to pursue a career in pancreatic cancer research. The Initiating PI on the Idea Development Award must mentor and collaborate with the Early-Career Investigator (Partnering PI) to promote their career development in pancreatic cancer research. The Early-Career Investigator must meet the specific eligibility criteria described in Section II.C, Eligibility Information. The Initiating PI will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The Initiating and Partnering PIs each have different submission requirements, as described in Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission; however, both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project, including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization. Projects involving convergence science partnerships are encouraged.

Successful applications to the FY24 VRP TRA should establish a clear path to transforming a promising discovery into new drugs, devices, or clinical practice guidelines that are ready for definitive testing in clinical trials. For new drug or device development, the investigative team should include at least one collaborator with expertise in the regulatory approval process. It is expected that, if applicable, an Investigational New Drug (IND)/Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application or international equivalent will be submitted to a Regulatory Agency during or by the end of the period of performance. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, Regulatory Agency refers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any relevant international regulatory agency. Partnering PI Option: The FY24 VRP TRA includes an option for two Principal Investigators (PIs). One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI will be identified as the Partnering PI. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development and execution of the proposed research project. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission. Research involving animals, human subjects, and human anatomical substances is permitted. The FY24 VRP TRA allows funding for a pilot clinical trial (PCT) component, but not a full-scale clinical trial. In contrast to full-scale clinical trials that are designed to determine safety or efficacy, the purpose of the PCT is to inform the feasibility, rationale, and design of subsequent clinical trials through limited clinical testing of a novel intervention. Applications that include a PCT component must also have non-PCT translational research component(s) DOD FY24 Vision Translational Research Award 5 (e.g., preclinical studies, non-PCT clinical studies) and will have additional submission requirements and review criteria. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that retrospectively analyze data generated from previously conducted clinical trial(s) are not considered a clinical trial. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule.

IIRA applications may involve translational and clinical research including studies in animal models, research with human data and/or anatomical substances, and research with human subjects, as well as correlative studies associated with a clinical trial(s); however, FL1 awards may not be used to support a clinical trial. An application that proposes a correlative study should be associated with a clinical trial(s), and the proposed study should address critical knowledge gaps in clinical outcomes, validate key research results, expand upon potentially game-changing results, or other impactful outcomes. Multidisciplinary collaborations are encouraged. Funding Level 2 (FL2): To support Investigational New Drug (IND) application-enabling efforts. The BMFRP recognizes the scientific and financial challenges associated with advancing promising, potentially life-changing, therapeutic agents from the laboratory to clinical evaluation. Data related to lead compound characterization; formulation and stability; absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion; dose/response; and toxicology are required before clinical trials can commence. The proposed studies under the FL2 IND-enabling efforts are expected to be empirical in nature, product-driven, and focused on the accumulation of data for a lead therapeutic candidate that will be included in an IND application submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). At least one and no more than three lead therapeutic candidates must be named at the time of application submission to meet the intent of the FL2 mechanism. Library screening or drug optimization studies do not meet the intent of FL2. The intent of FL2 awards is to perform the necessary evaluation of promising therapies that will lead to clinical trials; however, clinical trials themselves are not supported by this mechanism. FL2 applications must address the FY24 BMFRP Focus Area, “Find effective BMF treatments and cures.” Link to Additional Information: Grantor Contact Information: If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact: CDMRP Help Desk Phone:      301-682-5507 Email:       help@eBRAP.org CDMRP Help Desk Return to top Connect with Us Blog Twitter YouTube Alerts RSS XML Extract Get Adobe Reader Health & Human Services HHS.gov EEOC / No Fear Act Accessibility Privacy Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Disclaimers Site Map Community USA.gov WhiteHouse.gov USAspending.gov SBA.gov SAM.gov Report Fraud Additional Help Chat now with Grant Frequently Asked Questions Open default modal Your session will expire in 3 minutes.

This award is designed to provide investigators the opportunity to pursue serendipitous observations that may reveal entirely new avenues for investigation. Results of studies conducted through this award may provide the scientific premise upon which a new hypothesis can be based or initial proof-of-principle of an innovative hypothesis, laying the groundwork for future glioblastoma-focused research projects. The GBMRP encourages applications from early-career investigators and applications that include meaningful and productive collaborations between investigators. PIs with little to no previous glioblastoma experience are encouraged to collaborate with experienced glioblastoma researchers and/or clinicians. Key Aspects of the Hypothesis Development Award: Presentation of preliminary data is inconsistent with the intent of this award mechanism and is therefore strongly discouraged. However, proposals should be based on sound scientific rationale that is established through logical reasoning and critical review and analysis of the literature. Innovation: It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigators (PIs) to clearly and explicitly articulate how the proposed research project meets the exploratory intent of this mechanism and is innovative in the field of glioblastoma research. Impact: The PI(s) should articulate the short- and long-term impact of the proposed research on both the glioblastoma research field as well as the patient community. The anticipated impact must be significant and move beyond an incremental advancement. Partnering Principal Investigator Option: The FY24 GBMRP Hypothesis Development Award includes an option for more than one PI. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other PI will be identified as the Partnering PI. This funding opportunity allows one Partnering PI. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development and execution of the proposed research project. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission.

While individuals representing non-U.S.-based organizations cannot submit proposals, they can collaborate on projects with eligible U.S.-based organizations as sub-awardees.  Applicants from institutions that are part of the Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute (OECI), which are the University of Rhode Island, Ocean Exploration Trust, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the University of New Hampshire, and the University of Southern Mississippi, are not eligible to apply as these institutions have an annual opportunity to apply for NOAA Ocean Exploration funding via the OECI. Personnel from the above-listed OECI institutions may still collaborate with an eligible U.S.-based applicant on a proposal as a subawardee, but not as a principal (lead) or co-principal investigator.Before proposals from federal agencies other than NOAA can be funded, applicants must affirm that their agency has legal authority to receive funds from another federal agency for this type of work in excess of their appropriation. Because this notice is not proposing to procure goods or services from applicants, the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. section 1535) does not provide this authority. Applicants from authorized federal agencies and NOAA must be able and agree to take FY25 funding for proposed projects (both one- and two-year projects) and allocate those funds in FY25 (i.e., between October 1, 2024, and September 30, 2025).To be eligible to apply or receive an award, applicant organizations must complete and maintain three registrations; SAM.gov, Grants.gov, and eRA Commons. For each, the complete registration process can take 4 to 6 weeks, so applicants must begin this activity as soon as possible and well before the proposal due date. For more information on how to meet these registration and application submission requirements without errors, we advise all to carefully review relevant Applicant and Grantee Training modules: https://www.commerce.gov/ocio/programs/gems/applicant-and-grantee-training. Additional Information Agency Name: DOC NOAA - ERA Production Description: NOAA Ocean Exploration is soliciting proposals for ocean exploration-related projects under two themes: Ocean Exploration and Maritime Heritage. By supporting exploration (i.e., examining unknown or poorly understood areas of the seafloor, sub-bottom, or water column through initial assessments of the physical, chemical, geological, biological, archaeological, or other characteristics), NOAA Ocean Exploration seeks to advance our basic understanding of the unknown ocean. All proposed projects must support priorities in the NOAA Ocean Exploration Strategic Plan (https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/about/what-we-do/media/noaa-oe-strategic-plan_fy23-fy27.pdf) and should also consider the Strategic Priorities for Ocean Exploration and Characterization of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NOMEC_OEC_Priorities_Report.pdf). Proposed projects are not restricted to waters under U.S. jurisdiction, but proposals should address how projects will provide national benefit. For Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) funding, NOAA Ocean Exploration is soliciting proposals focused on one of the following two themes: OCEAN EXPLORATION: Ocean Exploration proposals should support exploration of unknown or poorly known ocean areas, processes, or resources in waters deeper than 200 meters or in tropical mesophotic environments. Projects can entail conducting ocean exploration (e.g., mapping and characterizing ocean habitats, combining seismic and acoustic methods), advancing ocean exploration through the use or development of novel technologies (e.g., autonomous systems, nondestructive sensors, artificial intelligence/machine learning), and/or analysis of ocean exploration datasets or samples that already exist and are publicly accessible. NOAA Ocean Exploration is particularly interested in projects that explore the physical, chemical, and biological environments and processes in the deep oceanic water column and projects that will improve genetic libraries for species-level environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis of deep-sea species. All proposals must demonstrate how the proposed project relates to at least one of the exploration variables identified by NOAA Ocean Exploration (https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/data/publications/exploration-variables.html). MARITIME HERITAGE: Maritime Heritage proposals should address the exploration for significant maritime heritage resources that improve our understanding of the past and inform decisions about management and preservation. Maritime heritage projects can be conducted at any water depth. NOAA Ocean Exploration is particularly interested in proposals that target conflict archaeology, incorporate Indigenous knowledge, or perform wide-area searches in areas poorly mapped for maritime heritage. NOAA Ocean Exploration welcomes the use of innovative technology and/or methods for quantitative assessment of targets to improve archaeological site identification and documentation. Informational documents about this funding opportunity are on the NOAA Ocean Exploration website at https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/about/funding-opps/welcome.html.

Key aspects of the FTTSA include: • Overarching Challenge: Team science is a collaborative effort that leverages the strengths of investigators specializing in different fields to address an overarching scientific challenge or question. To identify an overarching challenge or question that meets the intent of the FTTSA, investigators are strongly encouraged to consider barrier(s) to and/or gap(s) in the understanding, prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, and/or treatment of eye injury or visual dysfunction associated with military exposure and envision what may be achievable in 10 to 15 years. Based on the long-term expectation, investigators will identify what should and can be achieved in the short term and will design projects and research teams around these goals. • Research Projects ○ Applications shall include at least three but no more than five distinct research projects that together form a concerted and synergistic effort to address the overarching challenge. Each project, as well as the overall effort, must align with one or more of the FY24 VRP Focus Areas. The potential topics of individual projects are wide-ranging. The examples provided below are illustrative and not exhaustive: − Elucidation of molecular, cellular, and biophysical mechanisms of eye injury or visual dysfunction associated with military exposure − Identification of significant changes in pathophysiology over time after military exposure to inform targeted treatments − Identification of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets − Development and validation of therapeutic agents and/or devices DOD FY24 Vision Focused Translational Team Science Award 5 − Development and validation of drug delivery platforms appropriate for eye injury or visual dysfunction associated with military exposure − Development or improvement of clinically relevant trauma models − Design of protection to mitigate the impact of military exposure on eye and vision − Development of lightweight portable assessment or diagnostic capability ○ Individual projects must be capable of standing on their own scientific merits. The FY24 VRP FTTSA is not intended to support a series of research projects dependent on the success of any other project. Each project should propose a unique approach to address the overarching challenge and be capable of producing research findings with potential to impact the visual system trauma research field and/or patient care. Preliminary data to support the feasibility of each proposed research project are required. ○ Individual research projects may focus on any phase of research (e.g., basic, translational, applied, clinical, observational). The FY24 VRP FTTSA allows one of the projects to include a pilot clinical trial (PCT), but not a full-scale clinical trial. In contrast to full-scale clinical trials that are designed to determine safety or efficacy, the purpose of the PCT is to inform the feasibility, rationale, and design of subsequent clinical trials through limited clinical testing of a novel intervention. Applications that do include a PCT as part of the proposed research will have additional submission requirements and review criteria and should demonstrate sufficient understanding of regulatory approval requirements and the regulatory approval process. • Implementation: The research strategy to address the overarching challenge should include a detailed implementation plan for participating research groups to coordinate efforts, facilitate collaboration, and create synergy through open and frequent communication, interaction, sharing of results/data/resources, and other means as applicable and necessary. The coordination, collaboration, and synergy are intended to advance a solution beyond what would be possible through individual efforts. • Research Team: (New in FY24) The FY24 FTTSA is structured to have an Overall Lead Principal Investigator (PI) and multiple Project PIs. The Overall Lead PI will lead the overall effort as well as the execution of one project. The Overall Lead PI must have demonstrated success in leading large collaborative research project(s). Leaders of the other projects will be designated as Project PIs. Each PI may lead no more than one project. o The Overall Lead PI will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. Project PIs will have their own submission requirements. If recommended for funding, all PIs will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Overall Lead PI and Project PIs, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission. DOD FY24 Vision Focused Translational Team Science Award 6 o All key personnel should be committed to regular and open discussions of research plans, exchange of ideas, sharing of expertise and results, and other collaborative efforts. The CDMRP Science Officer assigned to a resulting award must be invited to participate in periodic research team meetings. The plan for such meetings should be noted in the application. A clinical trial is defined in 45 CFR 46.102 as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that retrospectively analyze data generated from previously conducted clinical trial(s) are not considered a clinical trial. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule.

It also aligns with USAID’s Local Capacity Strengthening Policy, which recognizes USAID’s commitment to collaborating with local partners to define their own vision for success; strengthen their ability to be effective and relevant actors within their local communities and contexts; and elevate local ownership in sustaining development results. Furthermore, this APS builds upon Agency policy, guidance, and emerging practice in the areas of systems thinking, collaboration, learning, and adaptive, contextually informed design and management. It prioritizes diversity and encourages approaches that shift decision-making power to local people who have traditionally been marginalized, such as women, youth, religious and ethnic minorities, LGBTQI+, and gender diverse people. It enhances USAID’s capability to work with diverse local partners, to learn from these engagements, and to share this learning broadly. INTERESTED APPLICANTS - PLEASE READ: This Locally Led Development APS is not a Request for Applications (RFA) or a Request for Proposals (RFP), and this APS does not serve as a general request for locally led development concepts. Interested Applicants must respond to specific documents that share USAID priorities in a specific country(ies) called “addenda” that may be issued throughout the year on grants.gov. These addenda, when added, can be found on grants.gov under “Related Documents” on the Locally Led Development APS page. Please visit this page periodically for opportunities that may be relevant to your country and focus areas. Concepts emailed to LLD-APS@usaid.gov or submitted via grants.gov will not be accepted.

This mechanism seeks to promote novel approaches to ending cancer through convergent science cancer research. Convergent science as defined by the National Science Foundation ( https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence/index.jsp ) “is a means of solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and forming novel frameworks to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation.” Convergent science taps into a variety of disciplines to answer the issues in cancer (i.e., prevention, diagnosis/detection, treatment, quality of life, disparities) including but not limited to biomedical sciences, data science, engineering, psychology, and chemistry. Convergent science breaks down the barriers of cancer research and builds a whole answer with tools from different areas of expertise. The CSCCA application must identify one of the FY24 Overarching Challenges as a unifying Focal Point for the consortium, and a minimum of three research projects addressing the Focal Point. Additionally, applicants must clearly define how their application investigates at least three different FY24 PRCRP Topic Areas . For example, brain cancer, neuroblastoma, and pediatric brain tumors are three of the FY24 PRCRP Topic Areas and would be acceptable. Three different types of pediatric brain tumors (i.e., pediatric medulloblastomas, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and pediatric astrocytomas) are not considered three different FY24 PRCRP Topic Areas and would not be acceptable. The proposed Convergent Science consortium should demonstrate the potential to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation, significantly advance cancer research, and have a profound positive impact on the lives of cancer patients or those at risk for cancer including Service Members, their Families, other military beneficiaries, and the American public. Consumer advocates should be integrated into and play an active role in the leadership and decision-making for the consortium. An individual advocate can only serve as an advisor and team member at one Research Site. The advocates must be cancer patients or a caretaker of patients from the FY24 PRCRP Topic Areas, be active in a cancer advocacy organization, and possess a high level of familiarity with current issues in cancer research. The advocates’ role should be independent of their employment with a participating institution.

Clinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), devices, clinical guidance, and/or emerging approaches and technologies. Funding from this award mechanism must support a clinical trial. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. Applicants seeking funding for research that does not meet this definition should consider one of the other FY24 VRP program announcements being offered. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document_DEC2022.pdf For the purposes of this funding opportunity, Regulatory Agency refers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any relevant international Regulatory Agency unless otherwise noted. If the proposed clinical trial involves the use of a drug that has not been approved by the relevant Regulatory Agency for the country where the research will be conducted, then submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, or equivalent, that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 312 may be required. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of record or the relevant Regulatory Agency if an IND, or equivalent, is not required. If an IND, or equivalent, is required, the regulatory application must be submitted to the relevant Regulatory Agency by the FY24 VRP CTA application submission deadline. In addition, applicants must provide documentation of communication from the Regulatory Agency indicating that the IND, or equivalent, is active/safe to proceed by March 1, 2025, in order for the FY24 VRP CTA application to be considered for funding.

Clinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), devices, clinical guidance, and/or emerging approaches and technologies. Proposed projects may range from small proof-of-concept trials (e.g., pilot, first-in-human, phase 0) to demonstrate the feasibility or inform the design of more advanced trials, through large-scale trials to determine efficacy in relevant patient populations. The FY24 MSRP CTA offers two funding levels (Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions ). Only one funding level may be chosen per application and the choice of application category is at the discretion of the applicant. The requested budget at each funding level must be justified and appropriate to the scope of the clinical trial proposed. The following are generalized descriptions of the scope of research appropriate for each funding level: • Funding Level 1 (CTA-FL1) supports small-scale, early-phase, proof-of-principle clinical trials to demonstrate feasibility or inform the design of more advanced trials, or other clinical trials that are appropriate for this funding level. Preliminary data relevant to the proposed clinical trial, preferably in subjects with MS, are required. • Funding Level 2 (CTA-FL2) supports larger-scale clinical trials at phase 1 or phase 2 that seek to show preliminary evidence of safety or efficacy (i.e., benefit of clinical or paraclinical outcomes) in relevant patient populations. Strong justification should be provided, which could include, but is not limited to, intervention type, trial duration, sample size, outcome measures, assessment tools, and frequency of assessment. Preliminary data relevant to the proposed clinical trial, preferably in subjects with MS, are required. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, Regulatory Agency refers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any relevant international regulatory agency unless otherwise noted. Key aspects of the FY24 MSRP CTA Award Mechanism: • Clinical Trial Start Date: The proposed clinical trial is expected to begin no later than 12 months after the award date or 18 months after the award date for studies regulated by the Regulatory Agency. • Preliminary Data Are Required: Inclusion of preliminary data relevant to the proposed clinical trial is required. • Study Population: The application should demonstrate the availability of and access to a suitable patient population that will support a meaningful outcome for the study. The application should include a discussion of how accrual goals will be achieved, as well as the strategy for inclusion of women and minorities in the clinical trial appropriate to the objectives of the study.

Federal agencies or institutions are not eligible to receive Federal assistance under this NOFO.  Collaborations and partnerships with NOAA laboratories, cooperative institutes, and centers are allowed. Federal employees are not eligible to be Lead-PIs. However, federal employees could be co-PI, co-I, and/or collaborators using in-kind contributions from their agency. A letter of support acknowledging participation in the proposed project by federal employees or federal contractors must be included in the application.

For-profit organizations may participate as contractors or through other arrangements pertinent to the project that do not involve the transfer of funds. Additional Information Agency Name: DOC NOAA - ERA Production Description: The Alaska and Arctic regions are significantly affected by climate variability and change. Risks of flooding and inundation present the region with economic, health, safety, and security challenges. As part of its mission to provide secure and timely access to global environmental data and information from satellites and other sources, NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) is working to enhance flood monitoring capabilities in Alaska. This award will provide Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding for grantees to acquire and evaluate the potential of using commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to help monitor the extent and impacts of flooding in Alaskan communities. NOAA’s current flood monitoring products for Alaska have significant limitations as compared to capabilities possible over the contiguous United States. Challenges include limited satellite data coverage, frequent cloud cover, snow melt, dense forest cover, ice jams, un-managed rivers, and limited user access. Acquisition and evaluation of SAR imagery through this award will explore how to address these challenges, improving utilization of satellite observations and enhancing data accessibility. Satellites with SAR sensors measure how energy reflects off the Earth to map surface features such as rivers, land, and floodwaters. Currently, SAR observations in Alaska are limited to coastal areas. There is limited SAR imagery coverage over Central Alaskan rivers, delaying the ability for emergency management personnel and forecasters to address the flood impacts. Additionally, current SAR observations can lack the resolution, low latency, frequencies, polarizations, and swath width to provide the timely and actionable data needed to support flood hazards. Adding targeted SAR observations from commercial imagery may address observation gaps. As authorized by the IRA, P.L. 117-169, Section 40004, this NOFO aligns with the direction to “accelerate advances in research, observation systems, modeling, forecasting, assessments, and dissemination of information to the public.” Funds will support products and information that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), analysis-ready, actionable, and authoritative.

Findings from the FY24 ETRA-funded research should ultimately support the generation of new or updated clinical applications, health care products, and clinical practice guidelines for Service Members, their Families, Veterans, and the American public. Research Scope: Applications to the FY24 TBIPHRP ETRA may include preclinical applied research (including animal research) and clinical research (including clinical trials). Applications must not include basic research21. The FY24 TBIPHRP ETRA may also support ancillary studies that are associated with an ongoing or completed clinical trial and projects that optimize the design of future clinical trials. This award may not be used to support studies requiring an exception from informed consent (EFIC). Clinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), diagnostics, devices, therapies, clinical guidance, behavioral interventions, emerging approaches and technologies, and/or new indications for products currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -cleared. A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document.pdf. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. Applications that include a clinical trial as part of the proposed research will have additional submission requirements and review criteria. For more information, see Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission and Section II.E.1, Criteria. Funded clinical trials are required to post a copy of the informed consent form used to enroll subjects on a publicly available federal website in accordance with federal requirements described in the 32 CFR 219. Multi-Institutional Clinical Research/Trials: As of January 20, 2020, U.S. institutions engaged in non-exempt cooperative research must rely on a single Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review and approve the portion of the research conducted at domestic sites (45 CFR 46.114(b)). If the proposed, non-exempt research involves more than one U.S.-based institution, a written plan for single IRB review arrangements must be provided at the time of application submission or award negotiation. The lead institution responsible for developing the master protocol and master consent form should be identified and should be the single point of contact for regulatory submissions and requirements. Communication and data transfer between or among the collaborating institutions, as well as how specimens and/or imaging products obtained during the study will be handled, should be included in the appropriate sections of the application. A separate intellectual and material property plan agreed on by all participating institutions is also required for multi-institutional clinical research/trials. Research Levels: The FY24 TBIPHRP ETRA offers funding for two Research Levels (refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions). Only one Research Level category may be chosen per application. It is the responsibility of the applicant to select the level that aligns with the scope of the proposed research. The Research Level should be selected based on the research scope and not on the amount of the budget. The following are generalized descriptions of the scope of the research appropriate for each Research level: • Research Level 1: Research Level 1 is intended to support smaller scope, less complex preclinical clinical research, or pilot/exploratory clinical trials. The maximum period of performance is 3 years. The application’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $700,000. • Research Level 2: Research Level 2 is intended to support larger scope, more complex preclinical, clinical research, or clinical trials. The maximum period of performance is 4 years. The application’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $1.5M. o Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option: The FY24 TBIPHRP ETRA (Research Level 2 only) includes an Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option that is structured to accommodate two Principal Investigators (PIs), one of whom is an Early-Career Investigator. The combined direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance in the applications of the Initiating PI and Partnering PI should not exceed $1.5M. o The PIs may have experience in similar or disparate scientific disciplines, but each PI is expected to bring distinct contributions to the application. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for most of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other investigator will be the Partnering PI. At least one of the Initiating or Partnering PIs must be an Early-Career Investigator. o The intent is not to create mentor-mentee arrangement. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project, including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. The application is expected to describe how the PIs’ unique experience/expertise combined as a partnership will better address the research question, how the unique experience/expertise that each individual brings to the application is critical for the research strategy and completion of the SOW, and why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts. o If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization(s). For individual FY24 TBIPHRP ETRA submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission. Rigor of Preclinical Research Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of preclinical research. The standards are described in SC Landis et al., 2012, A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 490:187-191 (www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Projects that include research on animal models are required to submit Attachment 9, Animal Research Plan, as part of the application package to describe how these standards will be addressed. Applicants should consult the ARRIVE guidelines 2.0 (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) to ensure relevant aspects of rigorous animal research are adequately planned for and, ultimately, reported. The ARRIVE guidelines 2.0 can be found at https://arriveguidelines.org/arrive-guidelines. If animal models are proposed, consider the following: • Pairing clinical populations to animal models in order to validate the clinical relevance and development of prevention, assessment, and treatment solutions is encouraged. • Proposed animal models should be well justified, supported within the literature, and clearly align with clinical relevance to the human condition. Relevance to Military Health: Relevance to the health care needs of Service Members, their Families, and Veterans is a key feature of this award. Investigators are encouraged to consider the following characteristics as examples of how a project may demonstrate relevance to military health: • Explanation of how the project addresses an aspect of psychological health conditions and/or TBI that has direct relevance to the health and/or readiness of Service Members, their Families, and Veterans. • Description of how the knowledge, information, products, or technologies gained from the proposed research could be implemented in a dual-use capacity to benefit the civilian population and also address a military need. • Use of military or Veteran populations, samples, or datasets in the proposed research, if appropriate. Collaborations between researchers or consultants at military or Veterans organizations and non-military organizations are strongly encouraged. These relationships can leverage knowledge, infrastructure, and access to unique data and research resources that the partners bring to the research effort, ultimately advancing TBI and psychological health research of significance to Service Members, their Families, and Veterans. A list of websites that may be useful in identifying additional information about ongoing DOD and VA areas of research interest or potential opportunities for collaboration can be found in Appendix 2. Awards supported with FY24 funds will be made no later than September 30, 2025. The CDMRP expects to allot approximately $16.0M to fund approximately four ETRA Research Level 1 applications and five ETRA Research Level 2 applications. Funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program, the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by peer and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. Funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. It is anticipated that awards made from this FY24 funding opportunity will be funded with FY24 funds, which will expire for use on September 30, 2030.

Funded research outcomes should lead to the development of health care products, technologies, and/or clinical practice guidelines that improve patient outcomes. Additional information about translational research can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829707/ and https://ncats.nih.gov/about/about-translational-science. Applications may include preclinical applied research (including animal research) and clinical research (including pilot/exploratory clinical trials). The FY24 TBIPHRP TRA may also support ancillary studies that are associated with an ongoing or completed clinical trial and projects that optimize the design of future clinical trials. This award may not be used to support studies requiring an exception from informed consent (EFIC). Clinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), diagnostics, devices, therapies, clinical guidance, behavioral interventions, emerging approaches and technologies, and/or new indications for products currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -cleared. Basic research is not allowed: Basic research is defined as research directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications toward process or products in mind. Preliminary data are required: Applications must include preliminary and/or published data to support the proposed research project. The FY24 TBIPHRP TRA allows funding for a pilot/exploratory clinical trial as PART of the funded research project where limited clinical testing of a novel knowledge product,5 intervention, or device is necessary to inform the next step in clinical translation. Such pilot/exploratory clinical trial studies should be small, make up only a portion of the research proposed in the Statement of Work (SOW), and be utilized to establish the feasibility of a potential approach or to aid in device or intervention refinement. Applications that include large-scale clinical trials do not meet the intent of the mechanism. Applications that consist entirely of a pilot/exploratory clinical trial or multiple pilot/exploratory clinical trials may be administratively withdrawn. A clinical trial is defined in 45 CFR 46.102 as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document.pdf. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. Applications that include a clinical trial as part of the proposed research will have additional submission requirements and review criteria. For more information, see Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission and Section II.E.1, Criteria. Funded clinical trials are required to post a copy of the informed consent form used to enroll subjects on a publicly available federal website in accordance with federal requirements described in 32 CFR 219. Multi-Institutional Clinical Research/Trials: As of January 20, 2020, U.S. institutions engaged in non-exempt cooperative research must rely on a single Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review and approve the portion of the research conducted at domestic sites (45 CFR 46.114(b)). If the proposed, non-exempt research involves more than one U.S.-based institution, a written plan for single IRB review arrangements must be provided at the time of application submission or award negotiation. The lead institution responsible for developing the master protocol and master consent form should be identified and should be the single point of contact for regulatory submissions and requirements. Communication and data transfer between or among the collaborating institutions, as well as how specimens and/or imaging products obtained during the study will be handled, should be included in the appropriate sections of the application. A separate intellectual and material property plan agreed on by all participating institutions is also required for multi-institutional clinical research/trials. Research Levels: The FY24 TBIPHRP TRA offers funding for two Research Levels (refer to Section II.D.5 Funding Restrictions). Only one Research Level category may be chosen per application. It is the responsibility of the applicant to select the level that aligns with the scope of the proposed research. The Research Level should be selected based on the research scope and not on the amount of the budget. The following are generalized descriptions of the scope of the research appropriate for each Research level: • Research Level 1: Research Level 1 is intended to support smaller scope, less complex preclinical and/or clinical research. Pilot clinical trials as part of the proposed research are allowed. The maximum period of performance is 3 years. The application’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $500,000. • Research Level 2: Research Level 2 is intended to support larger scope, more complex preclinical and/or clinical research. Pilot clinical trials as part of the proposed research are allowed. The maximum period of performance is 4 years. The application’s direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance should not exceed $1.0M. o Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option: The FY24 TBIPHRP TRA (Research Level 2 only) includes an Early-Career Investigator Partnering Option that is structured to accommodate two Principal Investigators (PIs), one of whom is an Early-Career Investigator. The combined direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance in the applications of the Initiating PI and Partnering PI should not exceed $1.0M. o The PIs may have experience in similar or disparate scientific disciplines, but each PI is expected to bring distinct contributions to the application. One PI will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for most of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The other investigator will be the Partnering PI. At least one of the Initiating or Partnering PIs must be an Early-Career Investigator. o The intent is not to create a mentor-mentee arrangement. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project, including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. The application is expected to describe how the PIs’ unique experience/expertise combined as a partnership will better address the research question, how the unique experience/expertise that each individual brings to the application is critical for the research strategy and completion of the SOW, and why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts. o If recommended for funding, each PI will be named to an individual award within the recipient organization(s). For individual FY24 TBIPHRP TRA submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI, refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission.

The award mechanism supports execution of a synergistic, multidisciplinary research program with the potential to have a significant impact on psychological health conditions and/or TBI through clinical applications, including health care products, technologies, and/or practice guidelines. Applications may propose applied/preclinical/clinical research (including clinical trials). Hypothesis-driven health services research, implementation science, and follow-up care research are also within scope for this mechanism. Key aspects of the FY24 TBIPHRP FPA include: • Overarching Challenge: FPA applications must describe a unifying, overarching challenge that will be addressed by the set of research projects proposed. The overarching challenge must be relevant to a critical problem or question in the field of research and/or patient care in at least one sub-area within one of the three FY24 TBIPHRP FPA Focus Areas. • Research Projects: Applications shall include multiple, distinct research projects led by individual project leaders that address complementary aspects of the overarching challenge. Applicants are required to submit three to five research projects, of which, a clinical research/trial project is strongly encouraged. While individual projects must be capable of standing on their own high scientific merits, they must also be interrelated, synergistic, and align with the overarching challenge to advance a solution beyond what would be possible through individual efforts. The exploration of multiple hypotheses or viewpoints of the same line of questioning is encouraged. This award mechanism is not intended to support a series of research projects that are dependent on the success of one of the other projects. Each project should propose a unique approach to addressing the overarching challenge and be capable of producing research findings with potential to impact the field and/or patient care. Individual research projects may include applied research, preclinical research, clinical research, and clinical trials. Proposed research projects must not include basic research.5 Preliminary data must be included to support each project’s hypothesis/objective(s). There should be a clear intent to progress toward translational/clinical work over the course of the effort. • Implementation: The research strategy to address the overarching challenge must be supported by a detailed implementation plan that identifies critical milestones and outlines the knowledge, resources, and technical innovations that will be utilized to achieve the milestones. A robust statistical plan and statistical expertise should be included where applicable. A plan for assessing individual project performance and progress toward addressing the overarching challenge must be included in the implementation plan. Plans to include an External Advisory Board (EAB) are encouraged; however, applicants must be careful to avoid potential conflicts of interest (COIs) during review of the application by ensuring no contact with, recruiting of, or naming of specific EAB members in the application. For multi-institutional collaborations, plans for communication and data transfer among the collaborating institutions, as well as how data, specimens, and/or products obtained during the study will be handled, must be included. An appropriate intellectual and material property plan agreed to by participating organizations is required in the application’s supporting documentation. • Research Team: The overall effort will be led by a Principal Investigator (PI) with demonstrated success in leading large, focused collaborative projects. The PI is required to devote a minimum of 20% effort to this award. The PI should create an environment that fosters and supports collaboration and innovation in a way that engages all members of the team in all aspects of the research plan. The research team assembled by the PI should be highly qualified and multidisciplinary, with identified project leaders for each of the complementary and synergistic research projects. The resources and expertise brought to the team by each project leader should combine to create a robust, synergistic collaboration. The TBIPHRP Science Officer assigned to a resulting award should be invited to participate in research team meetings (e.g., annual meetings of the entire research team). The plan for such meetings should be noted in the application. • Milestone Meeting: The PI will be required to present an update on progress toward accomplishing the goals of the award at a Milestone Meeting after the conclusion of year 2 of the period of performance. This virtual meeting will be attended by members of the TBIPHRP Programmatic Panel, CDMRP staff, the USAMRAA Grants/Contracts Officer, and other DOD stakeholders. Clinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), diagnostics, devices, therapies, clinical guidance, behavioral interventions, emerging approaches and technologies, and/or new indications for products currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -cleared. Proposed clinical trials should demonstrate feasibility or inform the design of more advanced trials that determine efficacy in relevant patient populations. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/ Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document_DEC2022.pdf. Research Scope: Applications to the FY24 TBIPHRP FPA may include preclinical applied research (including animal research), clinical research, and clinical trials/testing (or equivalent). The FY24 TBIPHRP ERA may also support ancillary studies that are associated with an ongoing or completed clinical trial and projects that optimize the design of future clinical trials. This award may not be used to support studies requiring an exception from informed consent (EFIC). A clinical trial is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46.102 (45 CFR 46.102) as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include a placebo or another control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes. Studies that do not seek to measure safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcome(s) of an intervention are not considered clinical trials. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://cdmrp.health.mil/pubs/pdf/Human%20Subjects%20Resource%20Document.pdf. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, research that meets the definition of a clinical trial is distinct from clinical research. Clinical research encompasses research with human data, human specimens, and/or interaction with human subjects. Clinical research is observational in nature and includes: (1) Research conducted with human subjects and/or material of human origin such as data, specimens, and cognitive phenomena for which an investigator (or co-investigator) does not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. Research meeting this definition may include but is not limited to: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) diagnostic or detection studies (e.g., biomarker or imaging), (c) health disparity studies, and (d) development of new technologies. (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies that do not seek to assess the safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy outcomes of an intervention. (3) Outcomes research and health services research that do not fit under the definition of clinical trial. Excluded from the definition of clinical research are in vitro studies that utilize human data or specimens that cannot be linked to a living individual and meet the requirements for exemption under §46.104(d)(4) of the Common Rule. Clinical trials may be designed to evaluate promising new products, pharmacologic agents (drugs or biologics), diagnostics, devices, therapies, clinical guidance, behavioral interventions, emerging approaches and technologies, and/or new indications for products currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -cleared. Proposed clinical trials should demonstrate feasibility or inform the design of more advanced trials that determine efficacy in relevant patient populations.

Respondents are advised that the Army Research Lab (ARL) is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. ARL will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred in responding to this RFI. It is the respondent's responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the information owner. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the submittal. The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is seeking information on interdisciplinary theories and models for collective influences on human judgment during information processing tasks and prior to collective decision making. This RFI is issued for planning purposes only, and it does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or suggest the procurement of any material, data sets, etc. The following sections of this announcement contain details on the specific scientific areas of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses. Background and Scope: During information processing tasks, the formation of judgments on the utility of information from a wide variety of sources by analysts (working alone or in teams) is influenced by (a) other people in their networks, (b) the available information they consume, (c) potential interactions with virtual agents, and (d) their own internal predispositions based on background, training, and values. These analysts’ capabilities and performance on such tasks can be expanded and augmented through intelligent systems or information agents leveraging technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or through additional information gained from social media and social networking platforms. However, such human-agent teaming approaches can lead to the emergence of new biases and challenges surrounding the reliability of such judgments made to accept/reject each piece of information being processed. These phenomena reside at the conscious and subconscious levels, further expounding the challenges to understand their impact on judgment formation. This RFI seeks to elicit interdisciplinary perspectives on the judgment formation process in the context of analysts being embedded in larger communities and inundated with algorithmically driven information.

Archive Date: Estimated Total Program Funding: $ 15,500,000 Award Ceiling: $ Award Floor: $ Eligibility Eligible Applicants: Others (see text field entitled ""Additional Information on Eligibility"" for clarification) Additional Information on Eligibility: Eligible applicants are institutions of higher education, other nonprofits, commercial organizations, international organizations, and state, local and Indian tribal governments. Federal agencies or institutions are not eligible to receive Federal assistance under this notice. Additional Information Agency Name: Department of Commerce Description: Changing climate confronts society with significant economic, health, safety, and national security challenges. NOAA advances scientific and technical programs to help society cope with, and adapt to, today's variations in climate and to prepare for tomorrow's.  Toward this end, the agency conducts and supports climate research, observations, modeling, information management, assessments, interdisciplinary decision support research, outreach, education, and stakeholder partnership development.  These investments are key to NOAA's mission of ""Science, Service, and Stewardship"" and are guided by the agency's vision to create and sustain enhanced resilience in ecosystems, communities, and economies, as described in NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan (NGSP) .   Fostering climate adaptation and mitigation, and, specifically, the development of an informed society anticipating and responding to climate and its impacts - is one of the primary pathways through which NOAA plans to advance its mission. The NGSP outlines NOAA's five-year climate objectives: 1) Improved scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its impacts; 2) Assessments of current and future states of the climate system that identify potential impacts and inform science, service, and stewardship decisions; 3) Mitigation and adaptation choices supported by sustained, reliable, and timely climate services; and 4) A climate-literate public that understands its vulnerabilities to a changing climate and makes informed decisions. NOAA works in partnership with Federal, academic, private, and international research entities, and places a substantial emphasis on productive partnerships and interactions with decision makers and other stakeholders.Within this context, NOAA's Climate Program Office (CPO) manages competitive research programs conducted in regions across the United States, at national and international scales, and globally. The CPO also provides strategic guidance and oversight for the agency's climate science and services programs and helps to integrate capabilities from across the agency to provide enhanced services to its constituents. Achieving the first of the NGSP climate objectives, an improved scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its impacts, requires a number of core capabilities be supported.  These core capabilities can be broadly categorized to include: (a) understanding and modeling, (b) observing systems, data stewardship, and climate monitoring, (c) predictions and projections, and (d) integrated service development and decision support.These core capabilities, in turn, will focus initially on the following societal challenges identified in the NGSP as early evidence of progress to be made by NOAA in providing sustained, reliable, and timely climate services:*      Climate Impacts on Water Resources*     Coasts and Climate Resilience*     Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems*     Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate*     Information for Mitigating Climate ChangeEach of the Competitions announced in this Federal Funding Opportunity addresses one or more of these core capabilities or societal challenges.  It is expected that applications submitted in response to this Opportunity will identify their relevance to NOAA's climate science and services by indicating which core capabilities and/or societal challenges will be addressed by the proposed work.  Application abstracts must include a paragraph describing the work's relevance to the NGSP's long-term goal of climate adaptation and mitigation as well as to the Competition that is being targeted.In FY 2012, we estimate that $15.5 million will be available for approximately 60 new awards pending budget appropriations.   It is anticipated that most awards will be at a funding level between $50,000 and $200,000 per year, with some exceptions for larger awards.
